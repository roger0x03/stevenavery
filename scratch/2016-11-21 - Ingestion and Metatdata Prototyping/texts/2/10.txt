would appear to be more consistent with the State’s theory of the crime than any
liability on the part of Mr. Tadych. The defendant does not explain the
relationship of the other facts recited to the crime. In the absence of motive,
certainly something more would be required than what is alleged to take the
information out of the category of speculation. Did Mr. Tadych know who Teresa
Halbach was? Did Mr. Tadych know that she would be on the premises on that
day? ls there any other evidence that would “directly connect” him to the crime?
These questions are not addressed in the defendant’s offer ofproof.

2. Andres Martinez. The facts offered by the defendant in support of his
argument that Andres Martinez may have potential liability are found at pages 1 1
through 14 of the Defendant’s Statement on Third—Party Responsibility. The offer
includes evidence that Mr, Martinez can be a violent man, as reflected in the
reported November 5, 2005 attack on his girlfriend with a hatchet. There are also
indications that he gave conflicting statements to the police department concerning
his acquaintance with the defendant and what he knew or did not know about the
crimes. Conspicuously missing from the offer is any indication that Mr. Martinez
had any opportunity to do harm to Teresa Halbaeh, let alone a motive to do so. He
denies being at the Avery salvage yard on October 31 and the court sees nothing in
the offer of proof to indicate that any other person places him on the property on

October 31. In addition, there is no indication that he knows who Teresa Halbach
