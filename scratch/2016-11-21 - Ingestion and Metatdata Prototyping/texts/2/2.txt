While the parties dispute its applicability to the defendant’s offer of proof,
the leading Wisconsin case on the issue third party liability evidence is State v.
Denny, 120 Wis. 2d 614 (Ct. App. l984).l The defendant in that case, Kent
Denny, was charged with first-degree Inurder. At trial, he claimed that he had no
motive to murder the Victim, but that a number of other individuals did. The trial
court refused to allow the defendant to present such evidence because it was not
accompanied by any evidence that the other individuals had an opportunity to
commit the crime or a direct connection to it. The Court of Appeals upheld the
trial court’s refusal to admit the evidence. In its decision, the court adopted What is
known as the “legitimate tendency” test. Under that test, a defendant seeking to
introduce evidence asserting the motive of a third party or parties to have
committed the crime must produce evidence that such party or parties had the

opportunity to commit the crime and that there is some evidence which is not

The defendant has alternately claimed that the Wisconsin Supreme court has or has not adopted the
Denny legitimate tendency test. In the defendant’s June 26, 2006 Defendant‘s Responsc to State’s
Motion to Prohibit Evidence of Third Party Liability (Denny Motion), defense counsel recogni7ed that
“Denny has been adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court and Avery acknowledges its application in
this case should he seek to introduce evidence of third party liability for Teresa Halbach’s death. See,
State v. Knapp, 265 Wis. 2d 278, 351—52: 666 NW. 2d 881 (2003), vacated an Oliver grounds. 542 US.
952 (2004), reaffirmed on remand, 2005 WI 127, 285 Wis. 2d 86, 700 NW. 2d 899.” at p. 3. By January
8, 2007, however, the defendant had come to the conclusion that “the Wisconsin Supreme Coutt has
never adopted Denny.” Defendant’s Statement on Third-Party Responsibility at p. 3. The court believes
the defendant had it right the ﬁrst time. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in Knapp as follows:

“The general rule, adopted by this court, concerning the issue is that evidence tending to
prove motive and opportunity to commit a crime regarding a party other than the
defendant can be excluded when there is no direct connection between the third party and
the alleged crime,” (Citing Denny) 265 Wis. 2d at 351.
