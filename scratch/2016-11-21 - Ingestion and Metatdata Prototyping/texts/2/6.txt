unknown, “it would be virtually impossible for the defendant to satisfy the motive
or opportunity prongs of the legitimate tendency test of Denny.” Id. at 296. The
court concluded that Denny did not apply to other acts evidence committed by an
unknown third party. Rather, the court reasoned that when a defendant offers other
acts evidence committed by an unknown third party, the court should apply the

evidence to suggest that some unknown third party committed the crimes charged.
The defendant has identiﬁed a number of persons by name who he claims were on
or near the Avery property on October 31, 2005 and would have had an
opportunity to commit the crime. Another distinction is that Avery is not seeking
to offer any other acts evidence. Rather, he wishes to offer direct evidence that one
or more identified third persons may have actually committed the crime. This is
exactly what the defendant in Denny attempted to do. Also signiﬁcant is the fact
