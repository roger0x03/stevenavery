HOLCOMB: No sir.

DAVIDSON: Hadn't been around him at all -

HOLCOMB: - No sir.

DAVIDSON: - Is that correct?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And so what you're talking about today is something that you re - are saying is happened back in - somewhere in '91 or '92, is that correct?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Now, I believe you mentioned that uh - Damien wore some black clothes. You wore black clothes too, didn't you?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. Now, um - back when you were going with Damien uh - he had a knife collection then, didn't he? 

HOLCOMB: I guess, yes.

DAVIDSON: And had lots of different knives?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And uh - even had a large knife with a compass on it, is that correct?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Now, do - you do know that Damien moved to Oregon in - around May or soon thereafter of 1992, is that correct?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And you do know that the family moved to Oregon -

HOLCOMB: - Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: - With their belongings, you do know that?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: But you have not seen him since May of '92, is that correct? I mean, you haven't been with him or - you may have seen him out somewhere, but you haven't been with him and talked with him, have ya?

HOLCOMB: No sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. Now, so the family - do you have knowledge that the family later moved back to Arkansas from Oregon?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir, I do.

DAVIDSON: You don't have any knowledge of - of whether Damien moved his knife collection out there or whether he brought it back, do ya?

HOLCOMB: No sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. And this particular knife - you're not trying to tell the jury that this is Damien's knife, are you?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: How long was the knife that Damien had?

HOLCOMB: About that long.

DAVIDSON: What was the brand name of it, do you know?

HOLCOMB: I don't know.

DAVIDSON: And did you see it on more than that one occasion?

HOLCOMB: I don't remember.

DAVIDSON: Ok. But as far as you can remember, it was that one time that you put your arms around him?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Now, I believe when Mr. Fogleman asked you - you said that that knife was similar, is that correct?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. Were there any other markings on that knife that you saw? Anything else that would distinguish it other than a compass on the end?

HOLCOMB: The jagged edge.

HOLCOMB: No sir.

DAVIDSON: Now when was the first time that you saw this particular knife? Not the other one, but this particular knife, when's the first time that you saw it?

HOLCOMB: Um - in Mr. Fogleman's office.

DAVIDSON: In Mr. Fogleman's office, and when would that have been?

HOLCOMB: It was um - a week or two ago.

DAVIDSON: A week or two ago, would - would it have been February the 14th? Does that sound right - Valentine's day? 

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And you gave a statement that day, is that correct? Did you write out a statement?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And did you say in the statement that it reminds you of a knife that Damien had?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And is that your testimony here today also?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: It reminds you of one he had?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. Now, how many knives did Mr. Fogleman show you?

HOLCOMB: Maybe five.

DAVIDSON: Maybe five, and uh - the - one second, please.

(pause)

DAVIDSON: Any of the other five knives, they look like Damien's knives too?

HOLCOMB: They look similar.

DAVIDSON: They look similar, too. Um - and -

(mumbling)

DAVIDSON: - And did this one also look uh - similar to one of Damien's knives?

HOLCOMB: No sir.

DAVIDSON: It did not, ok. Now of the other ones, are you saying they look similar to some of Damien's knives?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Which one was it - describe it for us.

HOLCOMB: One had a golden handle.

DAVIDSON: Now, let's go back to this large knife. Where did you say that it was when you saw it?

HOLCOMB: In his trench coat pocket.

DAVIDSON: In his trench coat pocket?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Um - was he holding it or did you just discover it when you um - when you hugged him?

HOLCOMB: Just when I hugged him.

DAVIDSON: Was it tied on in any way?

HOLCOMB: No.

DAVIDSON: No kind of sheath or anything like that with it?

HOLCOMB: I don't remember.

DAVIDSON: So that knife was in his pocket? That's all.

FORD: No questions.

FOGLEMAN: Deanna, was it unusual for Damien to have a knife?

HOLCOMB: No sir.

FOGLEMAN: Alright. And uh - did he ever tell you anything about why he carried the knives?

DAVIDSON: Objection, your Honor.

THE COURT: Overruled.

HOLCOMB: Because he said that he didn't feel safe.

FOGLEMAN: Ok. And um - how would you describe the relationship between Jason and Damien?

HOLCOMB: They just talked to each other and - except for when I was there.

FOGLEMAN: Ok. What do you mean by that?

HOLCOMB: Usually when I would walk up, Jason would stop talking. 

FOGLEMAN: Ok. 

(mumbling)

FOGLEMAN: Oh, uh - Deanna, I do recall a question I wanted to ask you. Uh - the knife that you described - that you also identified among other knives that I showed you, you said something about uh - one that had a golden handle, is that like a dagger?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

FOGLEMAN: Ok. And uh - now besides that knife - that folding knife that Mr. Davidson showed you, I showed you another folding knife too, is that right?

HOLCOMB: Yes sir.

FOGLEMAN: Alright then, what did you tell me about that knife?

HOLCOMB: He usually didn't carry folding knives.

FOGLEMAN: Ok. I don't have any further questions.

DAVIDSON: We have no questions, your Honor.

THE COURT: Alright, you're free to go. Thank you. Call your next witness.

FOGLEMAN: Call James Parker.
