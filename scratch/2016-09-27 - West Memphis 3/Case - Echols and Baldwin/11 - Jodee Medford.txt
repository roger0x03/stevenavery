DAVIDSON: So when you heard this, you weren't with them?

MEDFORD: Right.

DAVIDSON: Had you heard people talking about Damien before this?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Did you think - did you think he was kind of weird or something?

MEDFORD: Yes sir, 'cause he was dressed all in black and his hair was jet black and long and shaved on the side.

DAVIDSON: Ya'll always thought he was kinda weird looking, didn't ya?

MEDFORD: I had never seen him before that night.

DAVIDSON: You had never seen him before. You hear people calling him Edward Scissorhands?

MEDFORD: No sir.

DAVIDSON: You didn't hear that. Ok, how far were you away from him when you heard this conversation? About - did you earlier say about from this distance?

MEDFORD: I guess.

DAVIDSON: And what did he say before he said this?

MEDFORD: Before he said that he killed 'em?

DAVIDSON: Yes.

MEDFORD: I don't know, I was walking around and I just heard him - he said that "I killed the three little boys" and I turned around 'cause that didn't sound right and then he finished what he was saying.

DAVIDSON: And tell - tell me what else he said.

MEDFORD: He said, "I killed the three little boys and before I turn myself in, I'm gonna kill two more and I already have one of 'em picked out."

DAVIDSON: Ok. And then what did he say?

MEDFORD: And I - I went off and told my mom.

DAVIDSON: You went and told your mom, and who is your mom?

MEDFORD: Donna Medford.

DAVIDSON: Would it been - have been on the 7th day of June?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: So, that's after you had seen this on tv, isn't it?

MEDFORD: No sir.

DAVIDSON: No sir?

MEDFORD: Uh uh. 

(pause)

MEDFORD: Well, I think -

DAVIDSON: When was the first -

MEDFORD: - Yes, yes it was, 'cause I was like, babysitting and I saw him on tv and I called my mom and told her that that was him and she said "Ok."

DAVIDSON: Ok, so only after you saw something on tv did you contact the police, is that what you're telling us?

MEDFORD: But, I had told my mom, yes sir.

DAVIDSON: You had told your mom. You and your mom hadn't talked with the police before then, had ya?

MEDFORD: No sir.

DAVIDSON: Ok. 

(mumbling)


FOGLEMAN: Jodee, uh - Mr. Davidson asked you about this statement about you saying you don't know him, you just know of him and questioned whether that was the first time you had ever seen him.

MEDFORD: Um hmm.

FOGLEMAN: Down here at the bottom of the same statement, uh - what - what did you tell the police in your statement? By - where it starts with "That was the".

MEDFORD: (reading) "That was first time I had ever seen Damien and the he - and he might" - what? (pause) Oh, and " He was there too the next night".

FOGLEMAN: Alright, so you did tell the police that that was the first time you had seen him?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

FOGLEMAN: Alright, are you - is there any doubt in your mind who it was you heard say this?

MEDFORD: No sir.

FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, he also asked about your statement in here that you were with uh - your sister, Jackie, and her friend, Christy - how did you get to the ballpark that night?

MEDFORD: My mom.

FOGLEMAN: And who else? Who was with you?

MEDFORD: My si - me, my mom, Jessica, Jackie, and Christy.

FOGLEMAN: Ok. I don't have any further questions.


DAVIDSON: I did leave something, a bit too soon. Uh - now earlier you said that's the only time you have seen Damien, is that right?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: And uh - is that the way you remember it now? That's the only time you saw him?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: In the statement that you gave to the police, is it true that you said, "That was the first time I ever seen Damien and the next night, he was there, too."

MEDFORD: Um hmm.

DAVIDSON: Well, did you see him that next night?

MEDFORD: Yes sir.

DAVIDSON: Well that's not true then, now is it? You saw him more than once then.

MEDFORD: No, the first night I saw him was the night that he said that.

DAVIDSON: And - but earlier, I can't, uh - in our testimony, in what you said here today, you said that's the only time you've ever seen him. Now, which is it?

MEDFORD: It was the first time I seen him, not the only time.

DAVIDSON: What about uh - who else was there with you?

MEDFORD: With me?

DAVIDSON: Yes.

MEDFORD: At the girl's club?

DAVIDSON: Um hmm.

MEDFORD: Jessica and Jackie and Christy and my mom.

DAVIDSON: Who is Katie Hendrix?

MEDFORD: My cousin.

DAVIDSON: And wasn't she there, too?

MEDFORD: Yes sir, but we didn't bring her or anything.

DAVIDSON: Ok. What did he say the next night?

MEDFORD: He didn't - I didn't - I wasn't around him.


FOGLEMAN: Jodee, I did fail to ask one question, of those 6 or 7 people, do - you can't remember who they were, that were standing around Damien - did any of those 6 or 7 people say that they killed the three little boys?

MEDFORD: No sir.

FOGLEMAN: I don't have any further questions, your Honor.

THE COURT: Alright, you may stand down, you're free to go. Call your next witness.
