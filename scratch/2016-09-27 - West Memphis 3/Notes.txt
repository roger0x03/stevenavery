START:
Richard Ofshe - 113

Notes:

- What about language complexity of side? Thinking Misskelly peeps are just too high brow

Bugs in tagging-coloring:
- 07 - Vicki Hutheson - error in assignment at line 169 - mentions other side
- 08 - Lisa Sakevicius - error in assignment at line 216 - mentions other side
- Warren Holmes line 34 gives list of notions for detecting a valid testimony
- Warren Holmes line 48 - prosecution mentions the defence
- Warren Holmes line 353 - interjection

Counting switches.
- tried looking at switch counts of testimony, but doesn't seem to be that good
	in that entering of evidence can reflect that, what about a contention classifier?

Can't be sure this is the entire case...

Sources:
Interviews, news articles, etc.

Thoughts:
- who are the people involved & what are exemplar parts of the text that communicate 
	basic (agreed) information and prosecution-defense perspective
- what are the arguments of each side and how many of them are there?
- outputs are not new info but selected components from the corpus
- color coding for documents -- keep track of dialogue driven by prosecution or defense
- pure mining play of all data coming through -- hand writing recognition -- search for 
	maybe overlooked information -- tracking-monitoring of court's corpus for instances
	of case names
- can evidence be submitted at final statement? Like fraction of confession statement 
	corroboration?
- suggestibility of a confession? how much of response is repetition? learn from 
	confirmed false confessions?
- cultivate curated data sets for answering specific questions, reliability of 
	confession-testimony vs age-IQ class. 
- document type classification - dialogue vs. monologue -- will affect the labeling
