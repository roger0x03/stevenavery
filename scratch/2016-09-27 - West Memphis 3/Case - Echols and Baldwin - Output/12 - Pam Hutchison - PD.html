And in that regard, the court found that one that Damien Echols was an adult citizen uh - over the age of 18 years, that he was read his Miranda warnings on more than one occasion - I recall 3 times, that during that period of time that he was present in the police department uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[582] FOGLEMAN: (interrupting) Your Honor, I think it was only once on the Miranda warnings.</p><p id = "prosecution">[583] THE COURT: Well, I -</p><p id = "prosecution">[584] FOGLEMAN: I think it was -- by Mr. Misskelley.</p><p id = "prosecution">[585] THE COURT: No, Mr. Durham read them to him once, the uh - uh - Ridge read them to him once, and uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[586] FOGLEMAN: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[587] THE COURT: I thought there was one other occassion, atleast twice, I thought three times from my recollection of the testimony. Uh - we called witnesses, the state presented it's case with regard to the surpression hearing, you didn't call any witness other than Mr. Echols and ofcourse he alledged that he requested an attorney at some point. Uh - and as I recall it, it was after he had talked to Mr. Durham. Uh - the state didn't ask any questions that were asked of him or give any statements uh - in the third session at all, it only pertained to the first two. Mr. Echols' testimony as I recall it, and I believe I recited it in my ruling, was that he asked to speak to attorney Mike Everett after he had talked to his mother and that was uh - I don't remember the time now, but Mr. Everett - Senator Mike Everett, came and testified in this matter previously uh - he testified that from his notes, records, and account of that this lady, Mrs. Hutchison, is that it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[588] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[589] THE COURT: Called him at 5:48pm and that that was the first contact that he had had with them and that he did not arrive at the West Memphis police station until sometime after 6:20. Every statement involved in this had already been taken at that time, before he ever arrived. It would have been impossible for Mr. Echols to even know who his mother had contacted prior to 5:48pm, at which time all questioning had ceased. Now, what you want to do is bring it up in front of the jury, a denno hearing where I have already ruled uh - that the confession or statement or remarks, however you want to characterize them uh - that in some fashion the police mistreated Mr. Echols and his mother, is that what you want - is that what your intent and purpose to do at this time is?</p><p id = "defense">[590] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, I am not questioning your ruling in any manner, I understand that is a decision that has already been made by the court, however what happened that day to show when he was questioned, how they were treated, uh - the testimony has already been on that they've been followed and everything else, this is relevant information for the jury to see and -</p><p id = "defense">[591] THE COURT: Relevant to what issue in the case?</p><p id = "defense">[592] DAVIDSON: It's relevant to the way that they harrassed this kid, now they have gotten on there and talked about uh - these statements that were supposedly made that they didn't record, they didn't do anything else, it's relevant that he was back there for 8 hours that day, it's relevant the way they treated him, it's relevant that they didn't allow the lawyer to come in. Now, I understand your Honor, in the denno hearing taking that evidence, I understand why you made your ruling and we are certainly abiding by that, however that doesn't prevent us from putting on other testimony that was not put on before. Now, if you're taking that testimony alone, I understand why you said that with the facts that you just said before the court, but there are other facts that could come forth and I'm not asking you to change your ruling on that, but we're saying that the jury ought to be able to hear that evidence.</p><p id = "defense">[593] THE COURT: Alright. By the very nature of - of the proceeding, if I allow you to go into all this stuff, then the state's going to have to call Mr. Everett back so the jury can hear his version of it so he - so they can be uh - informed that it couldn't have happened the way she said and then you're going to call in 10 more witnesses -</p><p id = "defense">[594] PRICE: Well, they can certainly do that your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[595] THE COURT: Well, this is getting absurd gentlemen. I, I -</p><p id = "defense">[596] PRICE: Judge, it is also possible for a parent to hire an attorney for an adult son.</p><p id = "defense">[597] THE COURT: It's possible for an Aunt Suzie in Saginaw, Michigan to hire a lawyer for somebody too, it doesn't matter who hires a lawyer, what is the importance of that?</p><p id = "defense">[598] PRICE: Well, I mean, that was one of the arguements that was made up at the bench and I just wanted to clarify that your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[599] FOGLEMAN: I mean, it's who exercises the right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[600] THE COURT: Your friend next door can hire you a lawyer.</p><p id = "prosecution">[601] PRICE: Right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[602] THE COURT: It's the individual who is charged -</p><p id = "prosecution">[603] PRICE: If his mother hired Mr. Everett and Mr. Everett came up there and wanted to talk with Mr. Echols, it's certainly something - it's relevant and something that we can bring out and we can do that in front of the jury, if -</p><p id = "prosecution">[604] THE COURT: For what purpose?</p><p id = "prosecution">[605] PRICE: For the purpose of showing the jury what happened. The court has made it's ruling about the - did not surpress the statements but that does not prevent us from putting the same testimony on before the jury. If the state wants to call Mr. Everett or anybody else they wanna call, they're -</p><p id = "prosecution">[606] THE COURT: Well, are you alledging by that conduct in some way he was deprived of his constitutional perrogatives and his rights?</p><p id = "prosecution">[607] PRICE: At this time we're making the argument that Mr. Everett was up there knocking on the door and wanted to speak to Mr. Echols and it's time we bring that up in front of the jury.</p><p id = "prosecution">[608] THE COURT: Again, for what purpose?</p><p id = "prosecution">[609] PRICE: To show that this happened.</p><p id = "prosecution">[610] FOGLEMAN: But what relevance is it? Even if it did happen that way, what relevance would it have?</p><p id = "defense">[611] DAVIDSON: The relevance is that it shows their course of conduct. They've got their tunnel vision and they saw their person they were going for and they just went straight for it without looking at all these other people. </p><p id = "prosecution">[612] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, they have been asked about hundreds of people they've looked at.</p><p id = "defense">[613] DAVIDSON: Judge, one important factor is Mr. Price made an analygy that there were statements made and they should have been surpressed, they weren't, but we have a right to put this on. </p><p id = "prosecution">[614] FOGLEMAN: The clear and uncontraverted testimony and evidence at the surpression hearing was that Mr. Everett was never even present at the time that any statements were made or which the state introduced at trial and therefore, there was no issue that any statements that have been introduced against Mr. Echols were done at a time when he was being deprived of counsel because Mr. Everett hadn't even been contacted and for them to make allegations of this nature and to put on evidence that like you said opens up a can of worms that we then have to bring evidence to put on is not proper because it goes to the question of whether or not he was denied constitutional rights which is not an issue of the jury to decide but an issue for the court to decide outside of the presence of the jury.</p><p id = "prosecution">[615] PRICE: The key point Judge, is that my client was ta - even when Mr. Everett was up there, was still talking to the police. The prosecution has decided not to use those statements but the fact that he was up there and they were still talking to him and he - Mr. Everett wanted to talk to my client is - that is certainly relevant. Just because the state -</p><p id = "prosecution">[616] THE COURT: Relevant to what?</p><p id = "prosecution">[617] PRICE: The police misconduct in this case. The tunnel vision, the whole defense that we've been going for through the entire case, your Honor. That if Mr. Echols is up there - your Honor stated earlier that if they're not going to use any statements made after 5:48 or whenever the time that Mr. Everett arrived - if they were still questioning him when Mr. Everett gets up there, even if they decide they're not going to use it, ofcourse the court has speculated you know, that he probably said the same things, he had denied it for 8 hours, he probably denied it the entire thing, obviously if he had said anything different they'd probably want to use it. But I think, but the court can not stop us from putting on this testimony your Honor. It is certainly relevant. Just because the state doesn't want to use whatever information my client may have given during that interview, can not, we object your Honor from preventing us from putting forth our defense in this case.</p><p id = "prosecution">[618] THE COURT: And your defense is that the police had tunnel vision?</p><p id = "prosecution">[619] PRICE: That's one of our defenses.</p><p id = "prosecution">[620] THE COURT: I'm not sure that that's a recognized defense.</p><p id = "defense">[621] DAVIDSON: It's not, it's -</p><p id = "defense">[622] PRICE: It's an original defense your Honor, there's nothing that has been recognized about this case.</p><p id = "defense">[623] THE COURT: Well, that's true.</p><p id = "prosecution">[624] FOGLEMAN: Your honor, in order to rebutt that, I guess what we're going to have to do is go through each person the police looked at, when they looked at 'em, and we will be here 6 months. This comes as an exclusion of a waste of time. It's a waste of time going into all this stuff, it's nonsense. The number - and your Honor, this is an important point, no matter who hires a person a lawyer, unless that person exercises his right to a lawyer, it doesn't mean the lawyer represents the person.</p><p id = "defense">[625] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, Mr. Echols has never hired me. The court appointed me, that makes no sense.</p><p id = "defense">[626] PRICE: That's absurd your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[627] FOGLEMAN: And he accepted the appointment.</p><p id = "defense">[628] DAVIDSON: Yes, I did. </p><p id = "prosecution">[629] FOGLEMAN: Talking about Mr. Echols accepting your being appointed. </p><p id = "prosecution">[630] THE COURT: According to Mr. Everett, he never accepted the case either. He came over and got there at 6:20 or after, according to his recollection of it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[631] PRICE: The guy got paid $300.00 for accepting party.</p><p id = "prosecution">[632] THE COURT: Did he? He didn't testify to that, that's something I didn't know.</p><p id = "prosecution">[633] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[634] THE COURT: Alright. I'm going to recess for lunch then I'll rule on it before lunch. The court will be in recess until 1:00.</p><p id = "prosecution">[635] (back in session)</p><p id = "defense">[636] DAVIDSON: Did you ever rule?</p><p id = "defense">[637] THE COURT: Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead and let you do what you want, but I'm gonna let them cross examine on it too.</p><p id = "defense">[638] DAVIDSON: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[639] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[640] DAVIDSON: Ok, Mrs. Hutchison, I don't remember exactly where we left off so I'm going to start in again. Uh-</p><p id = "defense">[641] THE COURT: Not all over.</p><p id = "defense">[642] DAVIDSON: Not all over your Honor. Um - one area that we hadn't done uh - did your family move to Oregon at one point?</p><p id = "defense">[643] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[644] DAVIDSON: When did you all move to Oregon?</p><p id = "defense">[645] HUTCHISON: It was in '92, about May of '92.</p><p id = "defense">[646] DAVIDSON: In May of '92?</p><p id = "defense">[647] HUTCHISON: Uh huh. Uh - '91. In '91.</p><p id = "defense">[648] DAVIDSON: And prior to moving to Oregon, did Damien have a girlfriend?</p><p id = "defense">[649] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[650] DAVIDSON: And who was that girlfriend?</p><p id = "defense">[651] HUTCHISON: Deanna Halcomb.</p><p id = "defense">[652] DAVIDSON: And uh, how long did you all live in Oregon?</p><p id = "defense">[653] HUTCHISON: Um - approximately 9 months.</p><p id = "defense">[654] DAVIDSON: And did you move your uh - belongings to Oregon?</p><p id = "defense">[655] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[656] DAVIDSON: Ok.

You said he was there about 2 months - where did he go after that?</p><p id = "defense">[661] HUTCHISON: Um - he came back to live with Jack Echols.</p><p id = "defense">[662] DAVIDSON: Jack Echols?</p><p id = "defense">[663] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[664] DAVIDSON: And uh - that was his father by adoption?</p><p id = "defense">[665] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[666] DAVIDSON: And um - when did you all come back to Arkansas?</p><p id = "defense">[667] HUTCHISON: Um - February or March of '92.</p><p id = "defense">[668] DAVIDSON: Ok.

Tell us a little bit about Damien and the way he dressed.</p><p id = "defense">[679] HUTCHISON: Um - he liked black. He started wearing black at the time he was seeing Deanna uh - 'cause she also liked the color black. He went through a skateboard phase where he wore real baggy jeans and baggy shirts and strange looking tennis shoes. And every little fad that came along, Damien had to try to dress like they were. </p><p id = "defense">[680] DAVIDSON: So, this was one of his later fads or phases, this dressing in black?</p><p id = "defense">[681] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[682] DAVIDSON: And the shoes that we earlier looked at that were like the shoes that he had - or the boots, uh - did he wear those boots that he had quite a bit?</p><p id = "defense">[683] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[684] DAVIDSON: Is that the only pair of boots he had?</p><p id = "defense">[685] HUTCHISON: Um - I think it was the only pair like that, yes.</p><p id = "defense">[686] DAVIDSON: Ok.

And on that date of May 4th, your husband, Joe Hutchison, you and him had gotten in an arguement and in a span of a couple of hours, he packed his stuff up and moved back to his mother's?</p><p id = "prosecution">[764] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[765] DAVIS: Ok.

Now, Mr. Davidson asked you if your son had been acting unusual during that time period, you told Officer Ridge that that on that particular evening that Damien had gotten very emotional, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[768] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[769] DAVIS: On the evening of May 4th, when that occurred.</p><p id = "prosecution">[770] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[771] DAVIS: Ok.

And how was it that something as big as separating from your husband and him packing his stuff up uh - did it just not happen? Did ya'll not separate? Did he not leave?</p><p id = "prosecution">[800] HUTCHISON: No sir, it happened.</p><p id = "prosecution">[801] DAVIS: Ok.

Did it not happen that date?</p><p id = "prosecution">[804] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[805] DAVIS: What date did it happen?</p><p id = "prosecution">[806] HUTCHISON: May 9th.</p><p id = "prosecution">[807] DAVIS: Just 3 days before you talked to the police officers on the 12th? Ok. And so you talked to the officers on the 12th and you tell 'em that 8 days before, your husband and you had separated, but you made a mistake and you got confused, it was really only 3 days before you talked to the police officers?</p><p id = "prosecution">[808] HUTCHISON: I talked with the police officer on the one day and then when I went back the next time, I told him that it was the 9th.</p><p id = "prosecution">[809] DAVIS: Ok, and the next time when you came back and told him that it was the 9th, that was in September, correct? September of '93.</p><p id = "prosecution">[810] HUTCHISON: Uh - yes sir, I believe so.</p><p id = "prosecution">[811] DAVIS: Ok. But, in May, some 7 days after this incident, you told him that you separated from your husband on the 4th, is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[812] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[813] DAVIS: And it's your testimony under oath that you just got confused and didn't remember that it was just 3 days before, but that from May 12th when you talked with the officers until September, your mind became clearer and it actually was the 9th when you separated and your husband moved out?</p><p id = "prosecution">[814] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[815] DAVIS: Ok. Sometime between May and September, is when you changed your story, right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[816] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[817] DAVIS: Ok. Did something happen during that time period that cyrstalized or clarified your memory better than what it had been just 7 days after this incident?</p><p id = "prosecution">[818] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[819] DAVIS: Ok. Did you talk with other people?</p><p id = "prosecution">[820] HUTCHISON: I had talked with some other people, but that's not why I remembered.</p><p id = "prosecution">[821] DAVIS: And what was it that sparked your memory or caused you to remember?</p><p id = "prosecution">[822] HUTCHISON: My husband's birthday cake sitting on the table.</p><p id = "prosecution">[823] DAVIS: Ok. And it's your testimony that when you first told the officers that your husband wasn't there that he had moved out, that you were separated that you just didn't remember this birthday cake? And that you didn't remember that it was 3 days before, and not 10 days before?</p><p id = "prosecution">[824] HUTCHISON: Um hum, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[825] DAVIS: Now, you indicated as Mr. Davidson was asking you some questions, and I think these were your words, that his - Damien's dress was just one of those little fads that come along.</p><p id = "prosecution">[826] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[827] DAVIS: Ok. Well, his, he was into witchcraft too, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[828] HUTCHISON: I never saw him uh - do anything, that was - that had anything to do with witchcraft. </p><p id = "prosecution">[829] DAVIS: Ok. Did you ever read any of the books that he kept in his room?</p><p id = "prosecution">[830] HUTCHISON: Yes sir, I'm sure I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[831] DAVIS: Ok. Did you read the one uh - 'Witchcraft and Satanic Worship'? </p><p id = "prosecution">[832] HUTCHISON: Um - I don't know if I did or not.</p><p id = "prosecution">[833] DAVIS: Ok. And had you seen his book of shadows and one with the pentagram on it and the various incantations in there uh - had you seen that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[834] HUTCHISON: I believe I had.</p><p id = "prosecution">[835] DAVIS: Ok. And had you gone through it and looked at it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[836] HUTCHISON: Yes sir, I think I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[837] DAVIS: Ok. And at some point, how long was it before this incident occurred that you say his dress had changed?</p><p id = "prosecution">[838] HUTCHISON: Um - probably 2 years.</p><p id = "prosecution">[839] DAVIS: And when you say his dress had changed, had he started wearing this big, long, black trench coat?</p><p id = "prosecution">[840] HUTCHISON: Um - no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[841] DAVIS: Was he wearing this at about the time of the murders, was that something that he was frequently seen in?</p><p id = "prosecution">[842] HUTCHISON: Before the murders, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[843] DAVIS: Ok. And was he wearing all black as a usual attire? Or daily attire?</p><p id = "prosecution">[844] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[845] DAVIS: Ok. Well, you testified on direct that he wore mostly black, is that a fair and accurate statement?</p><p id = "prosecution">[846] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[847] DAVIS: Ok. And is that something that changed over these 2 years leading up to the time that he was arrested that his dress had changed, that he had gone from dressing one way to dressing that way?</p><p id = "prosecution">[848] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[849] DAVIS: Ok. And you mentioned that, I believe, he moved back from Oregon before ya'll did?</p><p id = "prosecution">[850] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[851] DAVIS: Ok. And wasn't that in fact as a result of him being hospitalized in Oregon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[852] HUTCHISON: I don't know if I'd say it was a result of that, but that was when he moved back, yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[853] DAVIS: And involved in that incident in Oregon, of which he was hospitalized, did the police have to be called in that incident? Or were the police called?</p><p id = "prosecution">[854] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[855] DAVIS: Ok. And in fact at that -</p><p id = "prosecution">[856] PRICE: Objection to relevance, your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[857] DAVIDSON: May we approach the bench?</p><p id = "defense">[858] THE COURT: Alright.</p><p id = "defense">[859] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[860] THE COURT: Boy, ya'll pop something new on me everyday. Well, I don't know, cross examine is the first I've heard of -</p><p id = "prosecution">[861] DAVIS: She testified that he came back, I think 7 months before they did and they stayed out in Oregon, I figured -</p><p id = "prosecution">[862] THE COURT: Nothing to do with him being hospitalized - what was he hospitalized for, just because I wanna know.</p><p id = "prosecution">[863] DAVIS: He was hospitalized for an incident in which he was uh - uh - the police had to be called, knives had to be taken away from him.</p><p id = "defense">[864] DAVIDSON: First of all, I don't think that's true, another thing is, if you get a conviction certainly, you can't use a prior past act to show that he acted in a conformity hereas, that does not show motive, opportunity, plan, preparation -</p><p id = "defense">[865] (mumbling interruption)</p><p id = "defense">[866] THE COURT: Ok. (pause) Objection Sustained.</p><p id = "defense">[867] PRICE: Thank you, your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[868] DAVIS: Mrs. Hutchison, let me ask you this, was it October of '92 when your son moved back to Arkansas and ya'll stayed in Oregon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[869] HUTCHISON: It would have been September or October, yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[870] DAVIS: Ok and as to clarify, in fact, on direct testimony you said '91, but it would have been the fall of '92, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[871] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[872] DAVIS: Ok. And would it be, were there some problems as far as relations between Damien and your husband at that time, or the person you were living with, I guess Mr. Hutchison, that caused Damien to move back to Arkansas?</p><p id = "prosecution">[873] HUTCHISON: I wouldn't say that's what caused him to move back, no.</p><p id = "prosecution">[874] DAVIS: Ok. But ya'll stayed there and he came back?</p><p id = "prosecution">[875] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[876] DAVIS: Ok. And as far as what, how he was conducting himself or where his beliefs were leading at that point, you were in Oregon and he was here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[877] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[878] DAVIS: Now, you gave us a description of what happened or what you said happened on the 5th, you said Damien woke up that morning, is that right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[879] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[880] DAVIS: Ok. And was it - what room did he sleep in the Tuesday night?</p><p id = "prosecution">[881] HUTCHISON: The middle bedroom.</p><p id = "prosecution">[882] DAVIS: Ok. Is that the one that you refer to as Michelle's bedroom?</p><p id = "prosecution">[883] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[884] DAVIS: Ok. Did Michelle ever sleep in Michelle's bedroom?</p><p id = "prosecution">[885] HUTCHISON: Once in awhile.</p><p id = "prosecution">[886] DAVIS: Ok. It strikes me as a little unusual, but why was it called Michelle's bedroom if Damien stayed in it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[887] HUTCHISON: Because it had mostly Michelle's stuff in there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[888] DAVIS: Ok. Well, where would Damien stay if he didn't stay in Michelle's bedroom?</p><p id = "prosecution">[889] HUTCHISON: When my husband worked nights, sometimes he would sleep in my bed, or on the couch.</p><p id = "prosecution">[890] DAVIS: Ok. And it's your testimony that this particular evening of the 5th or - yeah the 5th, that Michelle didn't stay in Michelle's bedroom. Michelle stayed on the couch and Damien stayed in Michelle's bedroom? Is that right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[891] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[892] DAVIS: And that's also what happened Tuesday night, the 4th?</p><p id = "prosecution">[893] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[894] DAVIS: Did that happen on Thursday night, the 6th?</p><p id = "prosecution">[895] HUTCHISON: Probably.</p><p id = "prosecution">[896] DAVIS: Ok. So that would just be the usual course of things, Damien stayed in Michelle's bedroom? </p><p id = "prosecution">[897] HUTCHISON: Most of the time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[898] DAVIS: Now, as far as Damien's practice of witchcraft, you said that you didn't know a whole lot about it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[899] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[900] DAVIS: Ok. And he didn't talk alot about it to you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[901] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[902] DAVIS: Ok. But you knew that he was involved in it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[903] HUTCHISON: I knew he was looking into it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[904] DAVIS: Ok, well, how long had he been looking into it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[905] HUTCHISON: I don't know for sure.</p><p id = "prosecution">[906] DAVIS: For a number of years, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[907] HUTCHISON: I think so.</p><p id = "prosecution">[908] DAVIS: Ok. Did it - was it your opinion that he was looking into it more closely as time went on or was it just this change of dress and these books in his room, was that just uh - a two year long passing fad?</p><p id = "prosecution">[909] HUTCHISON: I would still say it was passing.</p><p id = "prosecution">[910] DAVIS: Ok. Now, there was nothing unusual about going to visit the Sanders, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[911] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[912] DAVIS: And in fact, the Sanders that you referred to as far as going to visit on the afternoon of the 5th, those people would be considered I guess you and your husband's best friends?</p><p id = "prosecution">[913] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[914] DAVIS: In fact, ya'll had lived with them for significant periods of time over the course of you lives, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[915] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[916] DAVIS: Uh huh. And in fact when ya'll moved back from Oregon, ya'll moved in with them, right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[917] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[918] DAVIS: Now, in the statement that you gave to the officers - let me back up just a minute, you testified on direct that you stayed there no more than 30 minutes, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[919] HUTCHISON: Yes sir, something like that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[920] DAVIS: Ok. So I can, that would be accurate?</p><p id = "prosecution">[921] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[922] DAVIS: Ok. Now, when you talked to officers on May the 12th, and you talked with Detective Ridge and Detective Sudbury, you told them that you went to the Sanders somewhere around 5:30 or 6, didn't you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[923] HUTCHISON: I don't remember.</p><p id = "prosecution">[924] DAVIS: Ok. Your Honor, may I approach the witness and -</p><p id = "prosecution">[925] THE COURT: Yeah, go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[926] DAVIS: Ok, it's at the bottom of page 14 - your statement, Officer Ridge says "Alright, when did that occur?" referring to your going to the Sanders' house, and your response is highlighted in orange. What did you tell him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[927] HUTCHISON: Around 5:30 or 6.</p><p id = "prosecution">[928] DAVIS: Ok. And that was at a time, just approximately 7 days after this incident, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[929] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[930] DAVIS: And so you went sometime around 5:30 or 6, and didn't stay anymore than 30 minutes, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[931] HUTCHISON: Something like that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[932] DAVIS: Ok. Now, you also testified on direct that that day you went by the pharmacy to pick up his medication?</p><p id = "prosecution">[933] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[934] DAVIS: That you dropped off that prescription then you went back that afternoon, sometime in the afternoon period, and picked up his medication?</p><p id = "prosecution">[935] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[936] DAVIS: Ok. You remember telling Officer Ridge and Officer Sudbury just a week after this that you picked up that medication Thursday morning, that you went after you let Domini off, you took Damien home, and you didn't go by the pharmacy?</p><p id = "prosecution">[937] HUTCHISON: No sir, I don't remember.</p><p id = "prosecution">[938] DAVIS: Ok. If it reflects that in the statement would you deny that's what you told Officer Ridge and Officer Sudbury?</p><p id = "prosecution">[939] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[940] DAVIS: Ok. Now, when was it that Damien changed his name?</p><p id = "prosecution">[941] HUTCHISON: When he was about 16.</p><p id = "prosecution">[942] DAVIS: Ok. And you were telling us that he changed his last name because that was his adoptive father's last name?</p><p id = "prosecution">[943] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[944] DAVIS: Ok. Now what about that first name? Is that something, did ya'll have any contribution to that selection of first name?</p><p id = "prosecution">[945] HUTCHISON: In a way.</p><p id = "prosecution">[946] DAVIS: Ok. And how did that come about?</p><p id = "prosecution">[947] HUTCHISON: Because Damien wanted to become a Catholic priest.</p><p id = "prosecution">[948] DAVIS: Ok. Was that a fad that lasted very long?</p><p id = "prosecution">[949] HUTCHISON: Quite awhile.</p><p id = "prosecution">[950] DAVIS: Ok. Well, he did this at 16, how long did he continue his hopes for becoming a priest?</p><p id = "prosecution">[951] HUTCHISON: I would say 3 or 4 months.</p><p id = "prosecution">[952] DAVIS: Ok. And is that when - after that 3 or 4 months, his taste turned to the black clothing and that sort of thing?</p><p id = "prosecution">[953] HUTCHISON: Um - no sir, not at that time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[954] DAVIS: Now, if I've understood your testimony correctly, you said that you had not seen a knife like this in approximately 4 years?</p><p id = "prosecution">[955] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[956] DAVIS: Ok. Now, his knife collection - ya'll moved, when did ya'll move to Oregon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[957] HUTCHISON: In May of '92. I believe it's '92.</p><p id = "prosecution">[958] DAVIS: Ok. And he had a knife collection then?</p><p id = "prosecution">[959] HUTCHISON: No sir, not when we moved to Oregon.</p><p id = "prosecution">[960] DAVIS: Ok. So it's your testimony that he didn't start a knife collection until he was in Oregon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[961] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[962] DAVIS: Ok, and he never had one - got - if I understand correctly, then that would mean he never had a knife collection here in Arkansas, period.</p><p id = "prosecution">[963] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[964] DAVIS: Ok. So he started a knife collection in Oregon and then it was sold before you moved back?</p><p id = "prosecution">[965] HUTCHISON: No sir, it was sold after we moved back.</p><p id = "prosecution">[966] DAVIS: Ok. And so you brought the knife collection back and you sold them?</p><p id = "prosecution">[967] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[968] DAVIS: Ok. Were you personally involved in that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[969] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[970] DAVIS: Were you familar with what was in his knife collection and what knives he traded and had?</p><p id = "prosecution">[971] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[972] DAVIS: Ok. Where did he keep it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[973] HUTCHISON: My husband kept it in our bedroom.</p><p id = "prosecution">[974] DAVIS: Ok. And was that, did your husband all the time keep Damien's knife collection?</p><p id = "prosecution">[975] HUTCHISON: Most of the time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[976] DAVIS: Ok. Did that start after the incident out in Oregon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[977] HUTCHISON: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[978] DAVIS: Did he add to and trade and things like that with his knife collection?</p><p id = "prosecution">[979] HUTCHISON: Not in Oregon.</p><p id = "prosecution">[980] DAVIS: Do you know who they sold the knives to?</p><p id = "prosecution">[981] HUTCHISON: Uh - I think he sold them through an auction.</p><p id = "prosecution">[982] DAVIS: And were you there - you remember being at the auction where they were sold?</p><p id = "prosecution">[983] HUTCHISON: No sir, I wasn't there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[984] DAVIS: Have any reciepts reflecting?</p><p id = "prosecution">[985] HUTCHISON: No sir, I don't.</p><p id = "prosecution">[986] DAVIS: Ok. And that was - you say that was all left up to Joe?</p><p id = "prosecution">[987] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[988] DAVIS: Ok. But to your knowledge, it was at an auction and there's no reciepts?</p><p id = "prosecution">[989] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[990] DAVIS: Just to make sure that I understand this, when you talked with Officer Ridge and them on the 12th, one of the things you used as a - kindly a uh - a focal point to determine what had occurred on the 5th was this event of separation with your husband on the 4th.</p><p id = "prosecution">[991] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[992] DAVIS: And then, sometime in September, you tell the officers that no it wasn't - it was the 9th. </p><p id = "prosecution">[993] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[994] DAVIS: Pass the witness.</p><p id = "defense">[995] DAVIDSON: So how did you remember that it was the 9th rather than the 4th, I'm not sure that I really understood that.</p><p id = "defense">[996] HUTCHISON: Because I remembered the birthday cake.</p><p id = "defense">[997] DAVIDSON: What birthday cake? Tell us about that.</p><p id = "defense">[998] HUTCHISON: Joe's birthday cake, his birthday is May 9th and that's the day we separated.</p><p id = "defense">[999] DAVIDSON: And you celebrasted it on May the 9th?</p><p id = "defense">[1000] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1001] DAVIDSON: And you separated on that day also?</p><p id = "defense">[1002] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1003] DAVIDSON: Is there something about that event that makes - causes you to remember that?</p><p id = "defense">[1004] HUTCHISON: Joe's mother and I getting into an arguement and the cake being there.</p><p id = "defense">[1005] DAVIDSON: And when you later saw that cake I believe you testified - what about that causes you to remember?</p><p id = "defense">[1006] HUTCHISON: Just the fact that the cake was there 'cause I normally don't have a birthday cake there.</p><p id = "defense">[1007] DAVIDSON: Ok. Now, when Damien uh - when you all went to uh - pick up a prescription, did you later go and get a copy of his uh - pharmacudical records?</p><p id = "defense">[1008] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1009] DAVIDSON: Now, I'm handing you a document, could you identify that?</p><p id = "defense">[1010] HUTCHISON: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1011] DAVIDSON: And tell us what it is.</p><p id = "defense">[1012] HUTCHISON: It's the record of his uh - prescriptions. </p><p id = "defense">[1013] DAVIDSON: And where was that obtained?</p><p id = "defense">[1014] HUTCHISON: Marion Discount Pharmacy.</p><p id = "defense">[1015] DAVIDSON: Is that where you all got his medicine?</p><p id = "defense">[1016] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[1017] DAVIDSON: Is that where you did business?</p><p id = "defense">[1018] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[1019] DAVIDSON: And did you indeed go to Marion Discount Pharmacy on May the 5th of 1993?</p><p id = "defense">[1020] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[1021] DAVIDSON: Does that record also reflect a prescription on May the 5th of 1993?</p><p id = "defense">[1022] HUTCHISON: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1023] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we don't have any objection as long as it's understood that that doesn't reflect when the prescription was picked up. Only when the prescription was dropped off.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1024] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, I think the document will speak for itself and that's something that they can certainly question about - the document will speak for itself as to when the prescription was filled.

Of course you could call the pharmacist and ask.</p><p id = "defense">[1027] DAVIDSON: (talking over) You can call the pharmacist.</p><p id = "defense">[1028] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1029] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we would object to that 'cause it could give a misleading impression to the jury because I think that the time in dispute is when that was picked up, I don't think there is any dispute that a prescription was dropped off on the 5th. The question was when it was picked up and that has no relevance or any evidentuary value at all regarding that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1030] THE COURT: Does either of you know if the pharmacist can uh - enlighten us on that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1031] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I talked with the pharmacist -</p><p id = "defense">[1032] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, I object to him saying -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1033] FOGLEMAN: I'm not going to say what he said -</p><p id = "defense">[1034] DAVIDSON: - Saying anything.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1035] FOGLEMAN: I won't say what he said.</p><p id = "defense">[1036] DAVIDSON: Can we approach the bench?</p><p id = "defense">[1037] THE COURT: Alright.</p><p id = "defense">[1038] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[1039] THE COURT: Well, you can get from any business, you know, an exception, I guess -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1040] FOGLEMAN: I talked with the pharmacist, your Honor, and he said his record would not indicate when a prescription was picked up - often times it's when a prescription is dropped off on the form, and it may be the next day, it may be the same day, it may be 2 days later, and there's no way for him to tell when it was picked up.</p><p id = "defense">[1041] DAVIDSON: Well, we gotta call the man up 'cause the impression you give up there was that -</p><p id = "defense">[1042] THE COURT: Well, I mean, I can't let the record in without having a fair objective.</p><p id = "defense">[1043] DAVIDSON: Are you objecting on this record?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1044] FOGLEMAN: Well, not with the understanding it doesn't indicate when it was picked up. </p><p id = "defense">[1045] DAVIDSON: It shows when it was dropped off, if that's the only -</p><p id = "defense">[1046] THE COURT: It shows when it was prepared.</p><p id = "defense">[1047] DAVIDSON: The document speaks for itself.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1048] FOGLEMAN: But the document doesn't speak to -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1049] THE COURT: You can't get the document in without the pharmacist, so questionable if you want to stipulate as to what they want or do you want to call the pharmacist?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1050] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1051] FOGLEMAN: Well hey, if ya'll want to stipulate he can't testify - he can't say when it was picked up then we won't make him come up here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1052] THE COURT: In otherwords, you're saying that he - his testimony would be that he didn't have any idea when it was picked up, that that reflects -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1053] FOGLEMAN: That's what he told me.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1054] THE COURT: - the day when the prescription was made.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1055] FOGLEMAN: Or atleast dropped off or made or it may have been prepared or it may have even been filled that day, but that has no relation as when it's picked up. Huh?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1056] PRICE: (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1057] FOGLEMAN: I mean, your Honor, we don't have any objection as long as it's - they're trying to put it forth to suggest that it was picked up that day but that's not what the document, the document doesn't go to that about when it was picked up.</p><p id = "defense">[1058] DAVIDSON: It goes to when it was filled, your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1059] FOGLEMAN: Right. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1060] THE COURT: That's right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1061] FOGLEMAN: It has no relation of when it was picked up.</p><p id = "defense">[1062] DAVIDSON: Well, that's what this testimony is about and they can oversee -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1063] FOGLEMAN: Well, as long as it's understood that this document only goes to when it's filled and not when it's picked up.</p><p id = "defense">[1064] DAVIDSON: Well, that's for them to understand.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1065] FOGLEMAN: Well, if you're not willing -</p><p id = "defense">[1066] DAVIDSON: We can't get up -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1067] FOGLEMAN: - call the pharmacist.</p><p id = "defense">[1068] DAVIDSON: We can't get up there and every piece of evidence - we didn't do that to you - every piece of evidence say "Just so they understand" -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1069] FOGLEMAN: Well, if you're not willing to stipulate that this only goes to when it's filled and not when it's picked up, then you might as well bring the pharmacist in.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1070] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1071] (open court)</p><p id = "defense">[1072] DAVIDSON: Now, when you all went over to the Sanders that evening uh, -</p><p id = "defense">[1073] (tape flipped)</p><p id = "defense">[1074] DAVIDSON: - talked with you about that?</p><p id = "defense">[1075] HUTCHISON: A little bit.</p><p id = "defense">[1076] DAVIDSON: And what kind of difference did you discern out of that?</p><p id = "defense">[1077] HUTCHISON: What I got from Wicca was just suppose to be a love of nature, and that was the most that was ever explained about it - that we ever talked about it.</p><p id = "defense">[1078] DAVIDSON: And uh - was Damien into any kind of witchcraft?</p><p id = "defense">[1079] HUTCHISON: Well, if that's what they call Wicca.
