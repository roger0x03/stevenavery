I believe it was a couple months later. I was walking from my room into the living room -- I was in my room listening to the radio -- I was walking into the living room. My dad was watching something on the case on TV. They showed Jason's face and I told him that was who I was in there with, and I told him about it, about the stuff I knew. He goes, you need to tell somebody.</p><p id = "defense">[102] MR. FORD: Your Honor, I object to the father's words.</p><p id = "defense">[103] THE COURT: Sustained.

I mean, I had just got out of jail.

Why did Michael Carson no longer want to stay uninvolved? Why did you come forward and testify?</p><p id = "prosecution">[118] A: Because I saw the family on TV and saw how broken hearted they were about their children being missing. And I have got a soft heart. I couldn't take it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[119] Q: When you say, "the family," whose family?</p><p id = "prosecution">[120] A: The three boys' family.</p><p id = "prosecution">[121] Q: And after you came forward and talked with me, did you then talk with and give a statement to Officer Charlie Beall?</p><p id = "prosecution">[122] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[123] Q: Michael, I forgot to ask you this earlier, were you when you came forward and told me and then told Officer Beall, gave a statement to him -- were you offered anything as far as a reward or anything of that nature?</p><p id = "prosecution">[124] CARSON: No, sir, and if I was I would deny it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[125] DAVIS: Ok, did you ever request or inquire or ask for special treatment or anything of that nature in order for you to give this statement and provide this information?</p><p id = "prosecution">[126] CARSON: No, sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[127] DAVIS: That's all I have.</p><p id = "prosecution">[128] CROSS EXAMINATION</p><p id = "defense">[129] FORD: Mr. Carson, do you know who I am?</p><p id = "defense">[130] CARSON: No sir.</p><p id = "defense">[131] FORD: Ok.

When you get in the jail, it seems like everybody comes up to the front door to see who's off in there--who the new guy is. I did see his face then.</p><p id = "defense">[212] FORD: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[213] CARSON: The first night I was in there, I had--I knew he was in there because of the person I was in jail with.</p><p id = "defense">[214] FORD: Ok.

Or was I reading it the way it was typed?</p><p id = "defense">[262] CARSON: You are probably reading it the way it was typed but when he asked me the question if uh--he asked me the next day, I thought at that time he was asking the next day after the first time he denied it. The next day after he denied it was the day he told me that he did it and the day he admitted everything.</p><p id = "defense">[263] FORD: Ok, all right.

It's time for lunch --</p><p id = "defense">[508] CARSON: Yeah--</p><p id = "defense">[509] FORD: Is that right?</p><p id = "defense">[510] CARSON: --she said go to your cells it's time, yes, sir, it is right.</p><p id = "defense">[511] FORD: Ok. And, so what you're saying is for a period of five minutes after you were directed to go to your cells for lunch, you and Jason Baldwin sit at a table and have this conversation?</p><p id = "defense">[512] CARSON: No, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[513] FORD: Well--</p><p id = "defense">[514] CARSON: We did have the conversation.</p><p id = "defense">[515] FORD: And it took five minutes--</p><p id = "defense">[516] CARSON: When she tells you, she didn't say those exact words, pretty much like, "get ready" or something like that, I know it says that in there</p><p id = "defense">[517] FORD: But you're statements here are wrong?</p><p id = "prosecution">[518] FOGLEMAN: What page are you on?</p><p id = "prosecution">[519] CARSON: No, sir, they're not wrong.</p><p id = "defense">[520] FORD: On page three.</p><p id = "defense">[521] CARSON: I just misworded it.</p><p id = "defense">[522] FORD: You misworded it?</p><p id = "defense">[523] CARSON: I misworded it--if you can look at this, I misworded a lot of words off in here.</p><p id = "defense">[524] DAVIS: Your Honor, I got to enter an objection. Mr. Ford keeps holding up a document and saying your statements in here are wrong, and that's not proper cross-examination, if he wants to refer to specific statements --</p><p id = "defense">[525] THE COURT: Sustained</p><p id = "prosecution">[526] DAVIS: --and notify the witness --</p><p id = "defense">[527] FORD: Turn to page three. We've already read this just once. You said, "Well, we were sitting there playing cards and then the officer comes over the intercom and tells us to get into our cells because she's fixing to bring lunch in so me and Jason was just sitting there scraping up some cards, and I turned to him and said, 'Just between you and me did you really do it?' And he said, 'Yes, I did,' and he started giving me the gory details." And that's the five minute conversation that took place after the jailer says go to your cells, is that right?</p><p id = "defense">[528] CARSON: I said it was pretty close to five minutes.</p><p id = "defense">[529] FORD: Pretty close to five minutes. And so for five, you're allowed in jail that much leeway when they say go to your cell, you can sit there and continue your conversation for five minutes?</p><p id = "defense">[530] CARSON: Everybody's out of their cell during that time.</p><p id = "defense">[531] FORD: That's not my question. Can you sit there for five minutes and have a conversation or when they tell you to go to your cell, do you have to go to your cell?</p><p id = "defense">[532] CARSON: Yes, sir, you do have to.</p><p id = "defense">[533] FORD: Ok. But if that period, when you're supposed to go to your cell you just sit there for another five minutes and have this conversation, right?--</p><p id = "defense">[534] CARSON: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[535] FORD: --is that what you want these people to believe.</p><p id = "defense">[536] CARSON: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[537] FORD: Ok. Pass the witness.</p><p id = "defense">[538] THE COURT: Anything else? All right, you may stand down, you're free to go.</p><p id = "defense">[539] FORD: Your Honor, we'd like him to be subject to recall.</p><p id = "defense">[540] THE COURT: All right, I'm gonna allow you to go--</p><p id = "prosecution">[541] DAVIS: He needs to go back to school</p><p id = "prosecution">[542] THE COURT: I'm gonna let him to go back to school, but he'll need to be subject to recall.</p></body></html>
