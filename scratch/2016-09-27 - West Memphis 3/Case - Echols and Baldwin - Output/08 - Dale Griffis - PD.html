If the juvenile department of Crittenden County has got anything from my client when he was with the juvenile authorities, if that's confidential, and if that material has been turned over to the prosecuting attorney's office, which has been turned on over to Dr. Griffis, we object to that.

What rule of evidence is it?</p><p id = "defense">[994] FORD: I read it last night, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[995] THE COURT: Well, I'd be happy to see it.</p><p id = "defense">[996] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[997] THE COURT: Were all of these, all of this stuff, was it obtained prior to the murder? </p><p id = "defense">[998] PRICE: Yes. A year.</p><p id = "prosecution">[999] FOGLEMAN: Well, your Honor, after the murders, he's gonna get rid of everything.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1000] THE COURT: What is your theory of admissibility on this? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1001] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, that it's relevant once it's established that it's a cult-related killing. This is relevant to show his involvement and what he's participating in and whether this is, this is, the proof will show this is not Wicca. Neither is this, Wicca. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1002] PRICE: What is that, Mr. Fogleman? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1003] FOGLEMAN: That is satanic. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1004] PRICE: And how are you gonna, who's gonna testify to that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1005] FOGLEMAN: Mr. Griffis. </p><p id = "defense">[1006] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, the-what are you shaking your head at me for?</p><p id = "defense">[1007] GRIFFIS: I'm just, gimme a drink, counselor.</p><p id = "defense">[1008] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, we-</p><p id = "defense">[1009] THE COURT: I dunno, I've been shaking my head a bunch too. I couldn't tell you what about. All right, have you found that rule of evidence?</p><p id = "defense">[1010] FORD: No, no. I will.</p><p id = "defense">[1011] THE COURT: I'm reminded of a rule on habit in practice, too, that, that, uh, if you're talking about Rule 610, Mr. Ford, if, if religious beliefs or opinions. </p><p id = "defense">[1012] FORD: That's the specific rule. That's what we're talking about. "Evidence of the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the credibility is impaired or enhanced." And that's what they're trying to do.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1013] FOGLEMAN: We're not trying to impair or enhance anybody's credibility. We're showing motivation.</p><p id = "defense">[1014] FORD: Certainly they are!</p><p id = "defense">[1015] PRICE: The fact that my client has a picture a year before the murders is a motivation?</p><p id = "defense">[1016] DAVIDSON: From a skateboard magazine?</p><p id = "defense">[1017] FORD: Does this Rule 404 say this is, that, that right there is motive? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1018] DAVIS: Well, your Honor, it's certainly not, Rule 610 prohibits it for purposes of showing that, as to credibility is impaired or enhanced, and certainly what we're doing is in no way designed to show whether his credibility is impaired or enhanced. What we're showing is a belief system, and Mr. Price says that it's a year before and it has no relevance. Your Honor, a belief system, somebody's beliefs in things that they may act on, which is what the State is doing to try to show a motive, is something that the fact that they believed in a year is clearly, year before is clearly relevant. Uh, it's not something that, that happened one day and goes away the next. Somebody's beliefs that may be a motive for causing him to act on something that continue over a course of time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1019] PRICE: Judge, just because my client has writings in his room doesn't necessarily mean these are all his beliefs. A, a statement out of one of this, "Incense is used in all witchcraft ceremonies," there's no evidence that any kind of incense was used at the murder scene. Obviously, it's not relevant. The state is not alleging that it's a witchcraft murder anyway. You can go-there's reference to a 9 ft. circle. There's absolutely no evidence. I asked the officer earlier last week if there was any kind of evidence of a 9 ft. circle. He said no. So none of this stuff is relevant, your Honor. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1020] DAVIS: Your Honor, one thing we might point out in regard to the book, is that's not a printed book. That's handwritten. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1021] FOGLEMAN: And, it's handwritten, basically, some sort of ritual activity.</p><p id = "defense">[1022] FORD: Your Honor, if I could (unintelligible) the opinion of Jason Baldwin, that, if they're going to be able to use a juvenile file of Damien Echols to show that he had a belief and that he acted in conformity with that belief, then we should have been able to inquire as to the LSD dependence of Michael Carson, which is contained in his juvenile file to question his credibility because he had a drug dependence on hallucinogenics. (Crunching sounds of somebody eating something) If they're gonna be allowed to use that, the evidence file, the juvenile file of this defendant, we should be able to use the juvenile file of that witness.</p><p id = "defense">[1023] THE COURT: Can't find what I'm looking for. You also might wanna look at Rule 505 if you're claiming some kind of religious privilege, but, uh, what is habit practice of routine? Is that 500something? </p><p id = "defense">[1024] FORD: I'm not sure.</p><p id = "defense">[1025] THE COURT: Is that what you're offering if, uh, it's under?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1026] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we're offering, if the witness is allowed to testify that it's occult related or occult overtones to it, then we're offering this as evidence of his involvement in the occult.</p><p id = "defense">[1027] FORD: Is this character evidence? Is that what you're bringing it under? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1028] FOGLEMAN: No. Motive. Goes to motive. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1029] THE COURT: Well the rule, there's rule 404B, "Evidence of a person's character or trait of his character is not admissible for the purpose of proving he had acted with conformity therewith on a particular occasion except evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident." Here, all of this stuff we're going through, it doesn't go to whether or not either of the defendants committed the crime. It goes to that, uh, element of motivation, intent, scheme, uh, that sometimes the state can prove and sometimes they can't prove. They're not even required to prove motive, uh, however, and if, if they wanna attempt to do so they have a right to do so. The, I wanna deal first with the issue on how these items of evidence were originally obtained, and, and, and secondly whether or not there's any prohibition of their use as a result of any violation of any juvenile code. I'm more concerned about those two issues than I am up on the, the, the use ultimately in trial of these exhibits. Uh, cuz I think under Rule 404, they're entitled to use them with the cautionary instruction to the jury that they're considered only, uh, should be considered only for the purposes of going to prove motivation of opportunity, intent, preparation, planning, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident, and I'll give that cautionary direction if I allow them. Now let's deal with the first proposition. How were these items of evidence obtained? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1030] (TAPE FLIPPED)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1031] FOGLEMAN: As a result of his conversations he went to the residence of Mr. Echols of Lakeshore Trailer Park, uh, asked for permission to search Damien's room, searched his room, took these items, and, uh, turned them over to Jerry Driver of the juvenile office. </p><p id = "defense">[1032] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, we'd also point out that he was a juvenile then, and a juvenile cannot consent to a search.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1033] FOGLEMAN: He was a juvenile at that time, your Honor, but it was his mother who consented to the search, and I believe if my recollection is correct, there were charges, juvenile charges, arising out of what he was originally questioned about. But not related to the pictures.</p><p id = "defense">[1034] DAVIDSON: And, your Honor, those were held in his juvenile file, and turned over to Jerry Driver from there, and Jerry Driver then turned these over to the prosecutor when he started on his trek.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1035] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, that was after the murders, and there was an order entered by the court, uh, authorizing the release of the juvenile file to the West Memphis Police Department.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1036] PRICE: It was an ex parte order that we were representing Mr. Echols at the time and we did not have a chance to object to the order-</p><p id = "prosecution">[1037] THE COURT: Who entered it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1038] FOGLEMAN: I don't remember.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1039] PRICE: I think one of the juvenile-</p><p id = "prosecution">[1040] FOGLEMAN: Probably, same, same order y'all got.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1041] PRICE: I'm not blaming juvenile, Judge.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1042] DAVIDSON: The same order we got that was approved by Mr., Mr. Davis, right?</p><p id = "defense">[1043] FORD: And you couldn't, uh, and you wouldn't let us use it.</p><p id = "defense">[1044] THE COURT: Now, wait a minute. One at a time, one at a time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1045] FOGLEMAN: No, that related to medical privilege and you know that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1046] THE COURT: If you're talking about the stuff in the other case, that clearly didn't have anything to do with the issue before the court right now. That had to do with medical treatment. It had to do with privileged information, medical treatment that was required to be given by the physician.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1047] PRICE: But that's not true.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1048] THE COURT: Well...take it up on appeal.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1049] PRICE: We may do that, your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1050] THE COURT: Well, if you do be sure to put that point in, because I've ruled on that and I'm not gonna rule again.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1051] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1052] THE COURT: All right, y'all wanna say anything about how they acquired this?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1053] PRICE: Well, you gave a copy of the juvenile code, your Honor, that contains the section about confidentiality.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1054] THE COURT: Well, he's telling me there's an order from the juvenile judge giving possession of these items to, uh, law enforcement. In this case.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1055] PRICE: At this time, we want to object to that order because we didn't, we haven't had a chance to object to it until this point.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1056] FOGLEMAN: Well, your Honor, all I can say is that they were given a copy of it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1057] PRICE: That's true.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1058] THE COURT: In fact, I believe you used the same order to, to, uh, uh, receive the evidence.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1059] PRICE: That's correct, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[1060] DAVIDSON: It wasn't the same order.</p><p id = "defense">[1061] THE COURT: Are there two different orders?</p><p id = "defense">[1062] DAVIDSON: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[1063] THE COURT: Well, who signed them?</p><p id = "defense">[1064] DAVIDSON: You-uh-</p><p id = "defense">[1065] THE COURT: You wanna call Judge Wilson or, uh, Judge Goodson in here?

I just--</p><p id = "defense">[1088] THE COURT: It doesn't have to be necessarily be admissible for him to utilize it for his opinion. In fact, they can actually consider hearsay and matters that are not admissible in order to formulate an opinion.</p><p id = "defense">[1089] WADLEY: But your Honor, he can't consider that, Judge.

Like I said, there are two issues I wanted to take up. One is how those items that you just asked about, Mr. Ford, were acquired, and I can't remember what the second one was now.

Here clearly the court exercised its discretion and made those files available not only to the state and the law enforcement but to the defendants as well. Some mention was made as to, um, what was the young man's name?</p><p id = "defense">[1110] FORD: Michael Carson.</p><p id = "defense">[1111] THE COURT: Carson? You all wanted to utilize medical evidence that had been turned over, uh, as well, and that evidence had, was compulsory evidence obtained by action of the court that bore the doctor-patient privilege, and I ruled that that evidence, even though it might have been turned over under court order to defense counsel by the juvenile court, that the physician-patient privileged communications still pertained, not withstanding the order. Now, that deals with part of it. Now, the next issue is whether or not those four or five items...where are they? They were up here. Whether or not they're one, too remote to be considered as relevant in this case, number two, whether or not they're even relevant to any issue in this case, number three, whether or not it's an attempt on part of the State to prove, to prove character, testi-character, produce character evidence and suggest by that production, that the defendant acted in conformity with that, uh, evidence. And of course I point out Rule 404B, that an exception to that rule is where the evidence is offered to prove motive, intent, scheme or design. The only relevancy in this case for this type of testimony is to prove the possibility of a motive.</p><p id = "defense">[1112] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, along those lines, we could certainly argue that the, ah, obtaining of this material was too remote from the alleged crimes to make it relevant in any manner.</p><p id = "defense">[1113] THE COURT: All right, anybody else wanna have anything to say?</p><p id = "defense">[1114] DAVIDSON: In that it was in, when, 1991?</p><p id = "defense">[1115] THE COURT: '92.</p><p id = "defense">[1116] DAVIDSON: 1992? And also, your Honor, that, uh, we still maintain that this was part of a juvenile record and that, uh, uh-</p><p id = "defense">[1117] THE COURT: Well, juvenile court dealt with it, not me.</p><p id = "defense">[1118] DAVIDSON: Those are confidential items in that, uh, and that that order was obtained, uh, without us ever being, ever being there or apprised of it, uh, an ex parte order.</p><p id = "defense">[1119] FORD (maybe Fogleman): It was an ex parte order, your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[1120] PRICE: Because furthermore, if you actually look at these items, there's nothing in here that's relevant to this murder. Nothing in here relevant to, to any type of motive, or any evidence at the crime scene or anything of that nature.</p><p id = "defense">[1121] DAVIDSON. And because of that, the nature of that would be so highly inflammatory that its prejudicial effect would outweigh any probative value that it would have. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1122] DAVIS: Your Honor, the State's basis for believing that the probativeness outweighs the prejudicial effect is that in this case, because of the bizarre nature of the type murders that we're talking about, we feel it's very important and probably is going to be a prerequisite for the State to show some type of motive for these type killings. Otherwise, I think, people on the jury may very well, it may be beyond their comprehension how something or why something like this could take place, and I think it's going to be very important for the State to establish a motive as to why it occurred. We've brought forth an expert that has an opinion that these motives, that these killings were cult-related. Other evidence that reflects that directly ties these defendants in this particular case, these items directly tie Mr. Echols to a, and I think the expert can indicate that these items show a, a practice and a set of cult-related beliefs and practices of Mr. Echols, then that becomes highly probative for the State to put on in order to establish that motive, which although not required to be proven by the State, in a case of this nature, it's nearly incumbent on the State to present evidence in that nature. And here you have evidence that is relevant and probative as to that particular matter, and, uh, any evidence that is detrimental to the defendant, they can allege is prejudicial, but obviously, uh, the Court does not keep out evidence just because it's prejudicial. It's if that prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value. In this case, because of the need to establish motive, that probative value is important.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1123] PRICE: Judge, one of the items in here is a cure for worms. Worms has absolutely nothing to do with this case whatsoever. That's not one of the factors that could be a basis of a cult or a occult related killing. A cure for worms is just simply not relevant. Another thing-a cure for cramps. A cure for cramps is not relevant to any issue whatsoever in this case. A formula for a love spell is not related to any issue in this case. To improve the chances of success is not related to any issues in this case. And I, I, there are other examples in here as well. And just the fact that my client has some writings, I mentioned earlier that the rites are performed within a nine-foot circle. There's no testimony, I even asked Officer Allen and Ridge if there's any evidence of a nine-foot circle being at the crime scene. He said no. So obviously that can't have any relevance. Incense is used at all witchcraft ceremonies. There's no evidence whatsoever that the State has produced that there was any kind of incense at the crime scene. This is simply, it's just not relevant, and it's more the State's, um, the State is doing this to, to, to, to, I don't know what they're doing this for, Judge. But it's certainly damaging to my client. It's not, it is not relevant to any--</p><p id = "prosecution">[1124] THE COURT: It's not relative, relevant, how is it damaging to your client?

(Normal voice) It's nothing. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1136] DAVIS: Your Honor, Mr. Price seems to be arguing that if there is no statements in here of murder or whatever that that indicates that this item is not relevant. What we intend, that, what we believe the relevance is, that there will be testimony induced that these crimes had the trappings of an occult related homicide, and evidence that connects and shows a belief system of this defendant and, and shows writings of this defendant, which this expert can say are occult in nature, then become important as a factor in establishing that motive which we intend to prove and put evidence on by the (unintelligible).</p><p id = "prosecution">[1137] THE COURT: Okay, the next issue then is whether or not Rule 610 applies, whether or not it falls into the area of religious beliefs or opinions. And the rule is, "evidence of the beliefs or opinion of the witness on matters of religion is not admissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature his credibility is impaired or enhanced." Ofcourse, Mr. Echols is a defendant and not a witness, so I'm not sure that applies but I guess the theory would in some way. Anybody wanna talk to that? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1138] DAVIS: Your Honor, the reason that we're putting this -- I think 610 is inapplicable because, number one, it refers to a witness, and it's a rule that is designed to limit an attack on credibility of a particular witness by religious beliefs and that sort of thing. In this particular case, those religious beliefs or -- I guess you could call those religious beliefs -- those ideas or set of beliefs are the basis for the State's evidence as to motive in this particular case. And credibility of a witness based on beliefs is not even an issue. </p><p id = "defense">[1139] DAVIDSON: Well, we think it is, your Honor. We think that is the issue and that is the motive that they're trying to show. And furthermore, I believe that this does apply even though it does say witness -- rules of evidence do not normally talk about a witness, whether he's a plaintiff, a defendant, or a defendant in a criminal case. Very few of them do differentiate there. And we think that it certainly applies in this instance. </p><p id = "defense">[1140] THE COURT: Anybody else got anything they wanna say? (Pause) Are you trying to offer this under the theory of Rule 406, habit routine and practice? That is, "Admissibility. Evidence of the habit of a person or of the routine practice of an organization, whether corroborated or not and regardless of the presence of eyewitnesses, is relevant to prove that the conduct of the person or organization on a particular occasion was in conformity with the habit or a routine practice." In "The method of proof. Habit or routine practice may be proved by testimony in the form of an opinion or by specific instances of conduct sufficient in number to warrant a finding that the habit existed or that the practice was routine." </p><p id = "defense">[1141] FORD: Your Honor, this witness doesn't know these defendants, so how can he offer any evidence of habit or routine? </p><p id = "defense">[1142] THE COURT: I'll just ask if that was one of their theories of admissibility. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1143] DAVIS: Your Honor -- </p><p id = "defense">[1144] FORD: They haven't established that foundation. </p><p id = "defense">[1145] DAVIS: I think we're talking apples and oranges because what Mr. Ford is talking about is the opinion of this witness.

Frankly I don't think the Rule of 406 -- is that what you've just recited? </p><p id = "defense">[1146] THE COURT: Uh-hum. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1147] DAVIS: I don't think that's -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1148] THE COURT: Applicable. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1149] DAVIS: -- meets this factual situation. I think it's 403(b). </p><p id = "prosecution">[1150] THE COURT: 404(b). </p><p id = "prosecution">[1151] DAVIS: 404(b). </p><p id = "prosecution">[1152] THE COURT: Alright, anybody else wanna say anything? </p><p id = "defense">[1153] DAVIDSON: Well not now, if he concedes that 406 doesn't apply. </p><p id = "defense">[1154] THE COURT: I didn't really think it applied myself. (Pause) Alright, I'm gonna try to deal with the four or five items of proffered evidence. One, the Court would be of the opinion that inasmuch as a juvenile court order was entered transferring the custody of the proffered evidence to the West Memphis Police Department or the prosecuting attorney's office for use in a criminal investigation, that Judge Goodson in entering that order in compliance with Arkansas statute 9-27-309 made a discretionary decision that those items were no longer necessary to be kept confidential, and therefore the juvenile code would not apply. I don't think there's any dispute that that's how the State came by possession of the items, so in that regard they'll be admissible in this case. I'm also going to rule that inasmuch as the State has the burden of proof in this case and inasmuch as a good portion of the case is circumstantial, that it is necessary and appropriate that the State prove motive if they can. And, by this proffered testimony the State is attempting to establish motivation to enhance its case -- I suppose that'll be the way to put it. And I'm going to rule that the probative value of the testimony with regard -- or the proffered testimony with regard to motivation outweighs any possible prejudicial effect. I further will instruct the jury that the testimony with regard to occult or satanism or any other term you wanna add to it that relates to the same thing, cultism, cult, occult, satism, that it may be considered only for the purposes of determining motivation, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence or mistake or accident, that is offered only to show -- for the limited purposes of establishing motive. Anybody else wanna say anything? </p><p id = "defense">[1155] FORD: Your Honor, I hadn't -- I thought you were ruling on these particular items, but I hadn't finished my questioning -- </p><p id = "defense">[1156] THE COURT: Alright go ahead -- </p><p id = "defense">[1157] FORD: -- of this witness with respect -- </p><p id = "defense">[1158] THE COURT: Go ahead.

Now whether or not they died immediately from that blow or not, I don't think he -- anybody can voice an opinion. But again, I don't remember it exactly myself, but I think that was the substance of his testimony that they could have died from any one of a number of injuries. </p><p id = "defense">[1297] FORD: I'm asking -- moving in limine that this witness be instructed not to make reference to the number of mortal blows because he's not qualified to do so. And although the opinion may be based on statements that are hearsay, those statements cannot be injected into the record in that fashion. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1298] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, they can if they ask it, and that's how it came out the first time. </p><p id = "defense">[1299] FORD: I'm not gonna ask him. I wanna know for this in-camera proceeding, but I'm asking that -- </p><p id = "defense">[1300] THE COURT: You'd be entitled, and that's assuming I'll allow the testimony like I indicated I would, you'd be entitled to cross-examine him on the basis, and the factual basis for his opinion. And if you ask him what his belief or opinion -- that's not the right way. If you ask him about what he considered in the medical examiner's report as a basis for formulating his opinion as to the multiplicity of wounds, then he's gonna be permitted to testify what his view of that testimony was. </p><p id = "defense">[1301] FORD: And I'll also ask in limine, your Honor, that he not be allowed to indicate these boys were tortured. I'd like for him to be instructed not to do either one of those two things. And I'd like the Court to rule on that request. </p><p id = "defense">[1302] THE COURT: Well, again, I don't know that his opinion would necessarily require him to refer to the medical examiner's notes, but if he uses one of the facts and bases of his opinion, and I think he's been asked three or four times, think they were multiple injuries, he's gonna be permitted to do that. I mean, you can attack and challenge his testimony based upon the facts in the case. Goes to the weight of his evi -- weight of the evidence, not his credibility. As far as the second point I think the same thing is true. Anything else? Not his admissability, I said credibility. That goes to his credibility. </p><p id = "defense">[1303] FORD: Your Honor, we submit that his opinion -- there is no basis in fact. And that his opinion as to the motive of these killings is not based in facts, is not based on any scientific principles, it's not based on anything that allows an expert witness to give his opinion under chapter 7 of the rules of evidence, that this is not an expert opinion. That he's not qualified as an expert, and that there is insufficient link to Jason Baldwin. </p><p id = "defense">[1304] THE COURT: Well, -- </p><p id = "defense">[1305] FORD: And we -- Your Honor, that -- we submit that the language of the order in limine has failed to been met, to have established a link between Jason Baldwin and the occult. He knows of no evidence to establish this gentleman as a member of the occult and a practicing participant in the occult. He knows of no evidence. And in the absence of that, your Honor, his opinion is so prejudicial to this young man. And in the absence of any -- there's no link. And that's what the Court order requires -- </p><p id = "defense">[1306] THE COURT: Okay. </p><p id = "defense">[1307] FORD: -- the State to establish. And we would argue, your Honor, they should not be allowed to introduce this evidence as to Jason Baldwin. If the Court will allow it to Mr. Echols that the Court instruct the jury that the evidence of this witness is to be considered only in determining guilt or innocence of Mr. Echols, and not Mr. Baldwin. </p><p id = "defense">[1308] THE COURT: You wanna be heard on that? </p><p id = "defense">[1309] PRICE: Well -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1310] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, the only thing I was gonna add is, first of all, the testimony of Michael Carson, as indicated earlier, establishes that link. And, we expect there'd be other (inferences?) </p><p id = "defense">[1311] DAVIDSON: Your Honor -- </p><p id = "defense">[1312] THE COURT: You wanna add something? </p><p id = "defense">[1313] PRICE: Judge, in addition -- as another basis for our objection is it's our position that there's been no empirical data that's been brought forward at this hearing of any basis to form Dr. Griffis' opinion about this. If -- I'd remind your Honor of the ruling that the defense made in the Misskelley trial about Dr. Ofshe testifying, and the Court ruled that there was not empirical data for the basis of some of Dr. Ofshe's opinions about whether or not Mr. Misskelley's confession was coerced or not. </p><p id = "defense">[1314] THE COURT: Well there was quite a bit of difference in my ruling on Ofshe's testimony. You were trying to create a scientific and technical field under which his theories could fall. </p><p id = "defense">[1315] PRICE: The State is trying -- </p><p id = "defense">[1316] THE COURT: Further, the testimony of Mr. Ofshe went to the ultimate issue of the jury -- for the jury's determination, and I recognize Rule 704 or 705 allows the jury -- an expert to testi -- testifies to the ultimate issue in some circumstances. Here, Ofshe -- </p><p id = "defense">[1317] MR. PRICE: There's no scientific basis. </p><p id = "defense">[1318] THE COURT: Well, I'll point out two things to you. First of all, Ofshe testified to everything I said he couldn't testify to anyway. And two, I narrowed my ruling in that case to only a certain portion of his opinion. I allowed him to give testimony with regard to his expertise, his education, his knowledge in the field. But I limited him only on expressing an opinion that would be in a directive nature to the jury that, "This is my expert opinion and you must find such and such." That's totally different from the issue -- </p><p id = "defense">[1319] PRICE: But it's our position that there's no -- </p><p id = "defense">[1320] THE COURT: -- before the Court now. </p><p id = "defense">[1321] PRICE: -- scientific basis for the -- </p><p id = "defense">[1322] THE COURT: Well, -- </p><p id = "defense">[1323] PRICE: -- for this witness to testify that this is an occult related killing. </p><p id = "defense">[1324] THE COURT: Well. </p><p id = "defense">[1325] FORD: We join in that argument, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[1326] PRICE: We've asked him on numerous occasions, name some cases, name some -- and he can't even come up with the names of the cases. He mentions one or two or possibly three. Surely three cases cannot be a basis of a -- or you can have a scientific opinion or body of work which is the basis of his opinion. </p><p id = "defense">[1327] THE COURT: Okay, it's my ruling that this witness will be able to testify as an expert, as a person with specialized knowledge in the field of occultism that would assist the jury to understand the evidence and to determine the factual issue involving the motivation. And that he is qualified as an expert based upon his knowledge, his experience and his training in the area of occultism or satansim. And I don't know of any particular scientific field other than perhaps what he's indicated that will allow such testimony. But I'm going to allow him in that regard to testify in that regard. I think I've ruled on everything now -- the rest of your cross didn't change my mind. Is there anything you want a specific ruling on that I haven't already ruled on? </p><p id = "defense">[1328] DAVIDSON: We just want the record to reflect that we join in Mr Ford's -- </p><p id = "defense">[1329] THE COURT Well I think it did. </p><p id = "defense">[1330] DAVIDSON: -- (inaudible) </p><p id = "defense">[1331] THE COURT: Anything else?

What was that supposed to do? </p><p id = "defense">[1762] A: Give power, life force, transference of life force. </p><p id = "defense">[1763] Q: Now, is there -- in occultism is there any significance to right hand, left hand, or right side, left side? </p><p id = "defense">[1764] A: In satanism, yes. </p><p id = "defense">[1765] Q: Alright, and what significance is that, in any? </p><p id = "defense">[1766] A: Right hand -- they usually take the midline of the body right down the straight and they will refer to the right hand path as that for Christianity. Left hand path would be for satanism. </p><p id = "defense">[1767] Q: Now, in actual practice are there attempts to classify the persons who are involved in occultism into different categories to the extent of which they are practicing occult behaviour? </p><p id = "defense">[1768] A: In cases where there is suspected criminal activity we would look at the various levels or for classification. For example, we could have a follower, a leader, a traditional member, we could have a victim. </p><p id = "defense">[1769] Q: What is considered a traditional -- what is considered a traditional member? </p><p id = "defense">[1770] A: Traditional member would be somebody who belongs to a satanic church which is recognized in the state where they have filed corporation papers or are following traditional satanic beliefs -- </p><p id = "defense">[1771] Q: Alright. Now -- </p><p id = "defense">[1772] A: -- such as the American Church of Satan. </p><p id = "defense">[1773] Q: Who founded that church? </p><p id = "defense">[1774] A: Anton Sandor LaVey. </p><p id = "defense">[1775] Q: LaVey? </p><p id = "defense">[1776] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1777] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[1778] A: Walpersnaucht 1966. </p><p id = "defense">[1779] Q: Alright. It was established on Walpersnaucht? </p><p id = "defense">[1780] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1781] Q: Alright. And, what type -- are you familiar with any of the books that he's written? </p><p id = "defense">[1782] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1783] Q: What are some of those? </p><p id = "defense">[1784] A: He wrote The Satanic Bible, Satanic Ritual Book, and The Complete Witch. </p><p id = "defense">[1785] Q: And are those white witchcraft or black witchcraft? </p><p id = "defense">[1786] A: Those are black witchcraft. </p><p id = "defense">[1787] Q: Now, do you have something called a self-styled satanist? </p><p id = "defense">[1788] A: Yes, those are -- that boils down, counselor, with the different types of groups. </p><p id = "defense">[1789] Q: Okay. </p><p id = "defense">[1790] A: Which would start out with an experimenter, usually one who practices alone in an unorganized manner, a self-styled occultist and we are talking here only in the field of satanism. And this person has some kind of problems in life and they use the trappings of occultism to get along. Then we have an occult cult group, and this has a little charismatic leader and some followers. Sometimes they got a name for their group, sometimes they don't have a name for their group. But they use -- all three of those use the trappings of occultism. And then you have a traditional church that uses the traditional books on occultism. </p><p id = "defense">[1791] Q: Now, do you -- in looking at young people involved in the occult, do you see any particular type of dress or jewelry or body markings, anything like that? </p><p id = "defense">[1792] A: The ones using the trappings? </p><p id = "defense">[1793] Q: Yes. </p><p id = "defense">[1794] A: Yes. </p><p id = "defense">[1795] Q: Alright. And what type of things do you see? </p><p id = "defense">[1796] A: I have personally observed people wearing black fingernails, having their hair painted black, wearing black t-shirts, black dungarees, or that type of thing. Sometimes they will tattoo themselves. Either -- it starts out sometimes just with ink. And because they don't know the -- you know, everything liable put on the left as well as the right. Then they will use some earrings which have occult symbols on them, that you can buy through mail-order houses. </p><p id = "defense">[1797] Q: In regard to the tattoos, is there any particular area of the hand where tattoos might be? </p><p id = "defense">[1798] A: Two places. One would be on the middle finger of the left hand, and often times will be –- sometimes -- like I said, at what levels -- but in the web here of the hand. </p><p id = "defense">[1799] Q: Between the thumb and the index finger? </p><p id = "defense">[1800] A: Yes sir, right there. </p><p id = "defense">[1801] Q: Of the left hand -- </p><p id = "defense">[1802] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1803] Q: -- generally, unless they get it mixed up? </p><p id = "defense">[1804] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1805] Q: Now, do practitioners of satanism keep records or books of things, spells or things like that? </p><p id = "defense">[1806] A: Most occultists do but it depends upon how sophisticated what they do. </p><p id = "defense">[1807] Q: I wanna show you State's Exhibit 110 and ask if you – if you'll look at that and also -- have you seen that before? </p><p id = "defense">[1808] A: Yes sir, I have. </p><p id = "defense">[1809] Q: If you'll look through that again. </p><p id = "defense">[1810] (Pause) </p><p id = "defense">[1811] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1812] Q: Alright, and what does that appear to you to be? </p><p id = "defense">[1813] A: What I would refer to as a partial book of shadows. </p><p id = "defense">[1814] Q: Book of shadows -- </p><p id = "defense">[1815] A: A partial. </p><p id = "defense">[1816] Q: -- partial. </p><p id = "defense">[1817] A: Partial. </p><p id = "defense">[1818] Q: Alright. Now, the items drawn on the front, what is that? </p><p id = "defense">[1819] A: That is a pentagram, that happens to be a Wiccan, or white witchcraft pentagram. </p><p id = "defense">[1820] Q: Alright.

Now, explain what that is. </p><p id = "defense">[1823] A: That's confusion to me. </p><p id = "defense">[1824] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[1825] A: And the reason why we've got a white witchcraft pentagram, then we have upside down crosses which comes from another type of occultism. </p><p id = "defense">[1826] Q: What type of occultism do the upside down cross come from? </p><p id = "defense">[1827] A: That's black witchcraft. </p><p id = "defense">[1828] Q: Black witchcraft? </p><p id = "defense">[1829] A: Yeah, and that is at the stations. </p><p id = "defense">[1830] Q: That's what? </p><p id = "defense">[1831] A: That's at what we call the points, the five points. </p><p id = "defense">[1832] Q: Alright, what significance does that -- that it's at the five points? </p><p id = "defense">[1833] A: Usually in traditional occultism -- excuse me -- satanism they'll have various activities take place or -- </p><p id = "defense">[1834] Q: Okay. Now -- </p><p id = "defense">[1835] A: -- figures -- </p><p id = "defense">[1836] Q: In white witchcraft or wiccan do you have upside down crosses? </p><p id = "defense">[1837] A: No sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1838] Q: Now, I want to show you State's Exhibit 115. </p><p id = "defense">[1839] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1840] Q: Alright. And is that a photograph that appears to be of that except there are a couple of other items on the front. </p><p id = "defense">[1841] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1842] Q: Alright. And what significance, if any, is there to the items that are on the front of the book of shadows? </p><p id = "defense">[1843] A: Well, on the front there's overlaying, this pentagram there's an upside down cross. In black witchcraft that is a 180 degrees to Christianity. Then we have some kind of a flying skull here. </p><p id = "defense">[1844] Q: I also wanna show you State's Exhibit 112 and ask if that has any significance in occultism. </p><p id = "defense">[1845] A: The body here on top of what looks to be an altar is a head and it appears to be the same drawing of Ephias Levi. </p><p id = "defense">[1846] Q: Who? </p><p id = "defense">[1847] A: Ephias Levi. L-e-v-i. Bontamet, or a satanic goat head. </p><p id = "defense">[1848] Q: Okay. </p><p id = "defense">[1849] A: And below that is a person in a robe, and these robes I have seen sold in occult shops on the East Coast and West Coast. </p><p id = "defense">[1850] Q: Is this Wicca? </p><p id = "defense">[1851] A: No sir, this is black witchcraft. </p><p id = "defense">[1852] Q: I wanna show you State's Exhibit 111.

And in people involved in occultism, is there a particular type of artwork that you see associated with those people? </p><p id = "defense">[1855] A: The ones that I have observed have been involving necromancy or love of death. </p><p id = "defense">[1856] Q: Let me show you State's Exhibit 116. Now, on 116 -- when you look at 116 in relation to the other items that I've showed you, does that have any significance? </p><p id = "defense">[1857] A: Uh -- </p><p id = "defense">[1858] Q: When you take it in relation to all the other items that I've just shown you. </p><p id = "defense">[1859] A: On -- like the altar that's here -- several times I have had the opportunity to review pictures where they will have an animal's head on an altar or in a room usually have a candle on it. I've worked cases where they've dug up human heads. </p><p id = "defense">[1860] Q: Are different names, or you ever been involved in cases where different names were used? </p><p id = "defense">[1861] A: Yes. I mean -- you're asking have I seen -- books of shadows where they will have different names in them, yes. And these names are used inside the cult or their little group. </p><p id = "defense">[1862] Q: Now, those items that I've shown you, are those related to Wicca or white witchcraft or satanism? </p><p id = "defense">[1863] A: This is black witchcraft. I have not seen Wicca people use that. This one -- this kind of confuses me because I have seen people in Wicca, well-meaning have potions and elixirs. </p><p id = "defense">[1864] Q: Have you seen Wicca use upside down crosses? </p><p id = "defense">[1865] A: No sir. </p><p id = "defense">[1866] Q: I failed to show you -- I wanna show you State's Exhibit 83. </p><p id = "defense">[1867] A: Excuse me.

One, there is a chapter in here called, "Rising Devil," and it is underlined in red. Often times I get a look at books and the spinals are not broke on the back. You'll notice on this one it is not broken back, which to me indicates somebody hasn't read that part, and that part starts off with "Witch Hunt Mania." </p><p id = "defense">[1874] Q: Alright, I couldn't hear you. </p><p id = "defense">[1875] A: Witch Hunt Mania. That part doesn't look like it's been opened up for someone to read it. </p><p id = "defense">[1876] Q: Alright, now, there has been evidence that the defendant Damien Echols said something to the effect "The younger the victim, the more innocent. The more innocent, the more power." Are you familiar with words of an author containing that statement? </p><p id = "defense">[1877] A: Yes. Alistair Crowley. </p><p id = "defense">[1878] Q: Who? </p><p id = "defense">[1879] A: Alistair Crowley used that. </p><p id = "defense">[1880] Q: Who is Alistair Crowley? </p><p id = "defense">[1881] A: He was a gentleman from England, came to the United States, he started a group called OTO, and came to the United States, he started the Solar Lodge of OTO out in California. </p><p id = "defense">[1882] Q: I can't hear you. </p><p id = "defense">[1883] A: He started the Solar Lodge in California. </p><p id = "defense">[1884] Q: Solar Lodge? </p><p id = "defense">[1885] A: Solar, yeah, he called it Soto. </p><p id = "defense">[1886] Q: Okay.

(Pause) Do you know of Alistair Crowley's position on human sacrifice? </p><p id = "defense">[1892] FORD: Your Honor, that is objectionable. It's hearsay. He's asking him to testify about someone else's belief. </p><p id = "defense">[1893] THE COURT: I'm going to allow him to answer if he knows about it. Yes or no. </p><p id = "defense">[1894] A: He -- </p><p id = "defense">[1895] Q: Answer yes or no. </p><p id = "defense">[1896] A: No. </p><p id = "defense">[1897] Q: You're not familiar? </p><p id = "defense">[1898] A: No. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1899] FOGLEMAN: Okay.

(Pause) Dr. Griffis, you have testified that in your opinion that this murder have trappings of occultism. Now, are you aware -- are you saying that this picture right here, State's Exhibit 111, are you saying this is one of the bases of your opinion that the murders were trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1903] A: No. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1904] Q: Okay. And actually this -- this picture being something that the Crittenden Police Department, Sheriff's Office has had in their possession at least a year prior to these murders taking place, this would actually have no value in connection with your opinion, would it not? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1905] A: Not that picture, no. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1906] Q: Not this picture? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1907] A. No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1908] Q: Alright, how about this other picture right here that you described, the one with the goat's head and the altar, picture 112, which also has been in either the juvenile -- Crittenden County Juvenile Office or the Sheriff's Department for the past year.

No? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1917] A: Would you please -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1918] Q: Are you saying that this picture does have something to do with the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1919] A: It was shown to me last evening. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1920] DAVIS: Your Honor, I may enter an objection. The question is improper because Mr. Price, number one, presumes facts that aren't in evidence in his question itself. Number two, the Court's admonition to the jury that this testimony goes strictly to motive in regard to his testimony -- it may be evidence connecting motive where Mr. Price's question is directed directly toward whether it connects with the murder. There is a difference. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1921] PRICE: His opinion was that this murder had trappings of occultism. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1922] THE COURT: Alright, I think the proper question to ask the witness is, is that picture one of the things that he considered in formulating his opinion as to whether or not trappings of occultism occurred. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1923] Q: Alright, Doctor, is this picture one of the things you considered in determining whether occultism occurred as part of the motive in the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1924] A: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1925] Q: This is? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1926] A: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1927] Q: And you realize that this -- are you aware that this picture has not been in my client's home the past year prior to the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1928] A: I had not been. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1929] Q: If you're told that fact, does that change your opinion that this is a factor that you consider? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1930] A: I would have to -- I would have to know whether his activities changed. I don't know that -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1931] Q: Alrght, but -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1932] A: -- I would be making a guess, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1933] Q: But as far as the -- the existence of a picture in his house. That picture was not in his house a year -- for 12 months prior to the murders. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1934] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1935] Q: Would this picture in and of itself have any basis for your opinion that the motive of this killing was cult related? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1936] A: In and of itself -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1937] Q: In and of itself </p><p id = "prosecution">[1938] A: Would it have -- yeah because it is occult -- depicts an occult satanic scene, yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1939] Q: But if this picture has not been in his house for 12 months prior to the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1940] A: I -- I don't know how to answer that, I'll be very honest with you, sir. I would have to know what he had done for that 12 months. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1941] Q: Alright, but my question – and I'll get to what he's doing for the 12 months -- but my question relates to this picture. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1942] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1943] Q: This picture has been introduced at this trial against my client.

That question has been asked and answered two or three different times. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1946] PRICE: I'm asking him to explain his opinion about this. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1947] THE COURT: Well, I think he has. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1948] THE WITNESS: May I take this coat off? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1949] THE COURT: Yes sir.

In looking at this book here, I think you called it the book of shadows -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1956] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1957] Q: -- Exhibit number 110 -- the first writings in this book talk about, "The rites are performed within a nine foot circle." </p><p id = "prosecution">[1958] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1959] Q: Alright. Isn't it true that there is no evidence at the crime scene of a nine foot circle? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1960] A: That's correct, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1961] Q: In addition to this paragraph it also says that, "Incense was used in all witchcraft ceremonies." And isn't it true that there is no evidence of any incense at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1962] A: From what I've been told, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1963] Q: Alright, so this page in this book has nothing to do with -- does this page have anything to do with your opinion that the motive for the murders had trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1964] A: That page? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1965] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1966] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1967] Q: This page. Alright, the next thing it talks about "improving the memory. " Do that spell have anything to do with the crime scene? Another one is "a love charm." Do that have anything to do with the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1968] A: Not to the best of my knowledge. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1969] Q: Okay. "To improve the chances of success." Do that potion have anything to do with the crime scene of the murder? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1970] A: I -- that one I don't know. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1971] Q: Okay. Here's one, "a cure for worms." Was there any evidence of any worms at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1972] A: I have not seen the crime scene report, sir -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1973] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1974] A: -- as to that topic. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1975] Q: Okay.

Is there any evidence about cramps being an element of anything at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1976] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1977] Q: Earlier you testified about this particular book here and mentioned that part of the book -- part of the pages were opened and there was some lines underlined. You have no knowledge of who it was that underlined -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1978] A: No sir, I do not. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1979] Q: Alright. And I think you had mentioned one of the chapters in the book -- ofcourse this book has several different chapters. Chapter one about "Horned Gods and Mother Goddesses." Chapter two "Evolution of Witchcraft Magic." Chapter three "Witch's Brews and Broomsticks," Chapter four "The Pagan Witches," Chapter five "The Rise of the Devil," Chapter six "The Witch Hunt Mania." Chapter seven "Juvenile Witch Hunters." Chapter eight "The Resurrection of the Crab." Is there anything in this particular book that is your basis of the opinion that the motive for these murders had trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1980] A: I found it very interesting, counselor, that the only thing that was underlined in that dealt with devil worship and there -- if I remember correctly, there was a couple sentences in there referenced to blood and its life force. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1981] Q: But as far as anything in this book dealing with how to commit murders, how to kill somebody, anything of that nature. That type of material is not in this book, is not? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1982] A: Is it a black manual? No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1983] Q: Now, going back to the factors that you had stated that were some of the factors that you considered in making your opinion. You first talked about the fact that a particular date -- I think you said May the 1st and then also April the 30th, are important dates. Alright now – let me back up a bit, in looking at your analysis of this particular crime, did you take some satanist beliefs, some Wiccan beliefs, some occult beliefs and kind of mix it all together? Are you saying that this is a satanist crime? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1984] A: Indicators -- you know -- I've testified earlier, counselor, about the different types of occult activity. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1985] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1986] A: And from what I could see, the trappings were used were that of devil worship. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1987] Q: Of devil worship? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1988] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1989] Q: One of the factors that you testified to was about the date -- and is it your testimony that there are some -- I think you testified about April 30th and May 1st being dates of some type of importance? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1990] A: They have what is referred to as ethsabbaths. Ethasbbaths are higher holidays and those two dates are higher holidays. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1991] Q: Okay. You said "They." Who is "They"? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1992] A: Occultists. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1993] Q: Occultists? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1994] A: In general, the whole broad spectrum -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1995] Q: The whole broad spectrum -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[1996] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1997] Q: Is it your opinion that Damien Echols is an occultist? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1998] A: I looked at the information in total, counselor. Not whom did what. His name was on that particular book that you brought to my attention. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1999] Q: That's correct. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2000] A: And I found it interesting that Damien Echols underlined only the things which had to do with devil worship. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2001] Q: Alright, now you testified earlier that you did not know who underlined -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2002] A: Yes, that is true. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2003] Q: Okay. Are you saying that Damien Echols is a member of the occult? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2004] A: I'm saying that -- looking at the trappings of this type of case, looking at what the book -- whomever did that, that they have an interest in the trappings of satanic occultism. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2005] Q: In your opinion is there a difference between a crime that has trappings of occultism and a cult related crime? Can you draw a distinction between those two concepts? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2006] A: I -- counselor, what -- I know what you said but I don't know if that's exactly what you mean, alright, and I would like to answer it this way. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2007] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2008] A: A cult is something we have seen with David Koresh. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2009] Q: Okay. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2010] A: Okay. An occult group is in satanism. When you mix them together, when you have an occult cult group, you are liable to have whatever the leader may want. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2011] Q: Alright. In your opinion is Damien Echols a member of an occult group or a cult group? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2012] A: If that's his name and he's been -- that was -- in his writings he has an interest in it, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2013] Q: He has an interest in it? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2014] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2015] Q: Alright. But is it possible to have an interest but not be an actual member of a cult group? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2016] A: An actual -- occult group? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2017] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2018] A: Okay. I have priests and ministers will call me and ask me what does this mean or that mean, that doesn't mean they are occultists. But on the other hand, they don't have books that somebody has underlined with that either. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2019] Q: Okay. So a main factor that you are considering is the fact that my client possessed that book? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2020] A: That and -- yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2021] Q: Now, back on the dates, you said that May 1st and April 30th were key dates. Now these murders took place May 5th -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2022] A: Wait. I think you had that backwards, counselor. Did you mean to ask me on April 30th and May 1st? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2023] Q: April 30th is Walpersnaucht -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2024] A: Yeah. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2025] Q: -- and May 1st is Beltane. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2026] A: Beltane. I thought you got it transformed. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2027] Q: That's right, my mistake if I did. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2028] A: That's alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2029] Q: Alright, but as far as -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2030] A: I just wanna make sure I'm answering that --. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2031] Q: Sure, that's fine. The murders, that's on the testimony took place either May 5th or May 6th -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2032] A: Yeah. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2033] Q: -- so -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2034] A: It's my understanding that there was a full moon. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2035] Q: Alright, so is the fact of the full moon, is that a key factor that you're considering? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2036] A: That is one of the factors, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2037] Q: Alright. Now, if the murders would have taken place -- if there was no moon -- in your opinion it would not be a satanist killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2038] A: It would lower the degrees of -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2039] Q: Alright, if this -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2040] A: -- probability. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2041] Q: Alright. If the murders took place when it was a half moon, would that lower halfway? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2042] A: You're getting into semantics. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2043] Q: Okay. You testified that the manner in which the victims were tied -- I believe you testified it was a display fashion. Is it also true that the manner in which they were tied could be the basis of this being a sex crime and not a crime with trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2044] A: Could be. Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2045] Q: Yes. Alright, could you please state the name of the case that you investigated in which the victims were tied in this manner which turned out that case also had trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2046] A: I've never had one like that. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2047] Q: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2048] A: I've only had them where they have been displayed. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2049] Q: You have also testified that the type of injury was another factor that you considered in the terming, about the trappings of occultism. Is the type of injury also -- the fact that the genitalia were removed -- that also could be a factor in this being a sex crime, correct? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2050] A: Could possibly. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2051] Q: Okay, and could this also be a serial killing type of crime? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2052] A: Serial killers usually leave something or take something from the scene. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2053] Q: Okay. And you have also testified that the type of -- the torture was another factor based on your opinion. Can you state -- tell the ladies and gentlemen of the jury which case it was that you had investigated in which it was decided it had trappings of occultism in which torture was a factor? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2054] A: This was in Warwick, Rhode Island, a female was killed inside a pentagram. She was raped and hit with a -- slashed with a knife a couple times and after she was incapacitated, they burned her up, set her on fire. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2055] Q: Alright. Was -- in that case did they actually find a pentagram? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2056] A: Yes sir, they did. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2057] Q: Alright. And you're aware -- in this case the officers never found any kind of pentagram? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2058] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2059] Q: Or they didn't find any kind of nine foot circle? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2060] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2061] Q: You also testified -- just stated a minute ago, in the Rhode Island case that they burned up the victim. Is fire another factor that you look at to determine if fire is present to see if the case has trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2062] A: Uh-hum. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2063] Q: Okay. And in looking at the evidence is our case there was no evidence of fire. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2064] A: That's one of the things. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2065] Q: Another factor that you testified to earlier was about the presence of water. Is it true that the bodies could have been placed in the water in order to drown them? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2066] A: That's what the Medical Examiner said to me. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2067] Q: So would you agree with me that that could be one of the reasons they were placed in the water? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2068] A: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2069] Q: And also, is it true the bodies could also have been placed in water to help avoid detection of the bodies? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2070] A: Is that possible? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2071] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2072] A: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2073] Q: So the fact that the bodies were found near the presence of water, that in and of itself does not make this a trappings of occult related killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2074] A: Usually in occult cases they will be around a water source. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2075] Q: Alright, and what is a case in which you've investigated and in which there was a determination that it had trappings of an occult related killing which was around a water source? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2076] A: The one in Michigan where the boy is now in Ionia prison. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2077] Q: Okay. Just the Michigan case. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2078] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2079] Q: You also have testified that the sucking of blood was a factor to consider, and that blood is a life force, and you mention that they usually, they will take the blood. Did you have a chance to -- I'm sure you've discussed with the Medical Examiner the amount and the loss of blood in all three of the victims in this case? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2080] A: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2081] Q: Alright, and I'm sure you looked at the autopsy photographs -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2082] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2083] Q: -- and read the autopsies? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2084] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2085] Q: And, of the three victims, only one of the victims -- strike that. Do you have an opinion as to where all the blood went in this case? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2086] A: No I don't. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2087] Q: Is the fact that the absence of blood at the crime scene -- could that also mean the victims were killed elsewhere and deposited at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2088] A: Could be. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2089] Q: You also testified about the significance of the left side of the face and the right side of the face, with the left side having reference to satanism and the right side to Christians.</p><p id = "prosecution">[2090] Is one of your factors because one of the victims had more injuries on the left side of the face -- that's another factor that this case had trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2091] A: Not -- it had some. A little. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2092] Q: But not a significant -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2093] A: -- I found it of interest. How would you -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2094] Q: -- You would agree with me if a victim is receiving facial injuries, there is a fifty percent chance they'd receive injuries to the left side and a fifty percent chance to the right side, correct? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2095] A: Ah, yes, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2096] Q: You also made reference to Anton LaVey and the Satanic Bible. Have you ever read the Satanic Bible? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2097] A: Yes, I have. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2098] Q: Was this in preparation of the research that you were doing to help you better able to consult with law enforcement officers? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2099] A: Yes. I met Anton LaVey. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2100] Q: You also mentioned about the factors of dress, jewelry and tattoos. And you mentioned the wearing of black could be a factor that you considered in determining if this was cult related? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2101] A: In -- you're going to have to go over that one again. I want to make sure I understand what you're saying. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2102] Q: Is the fact -- the State has introduced fifteen black tee shirts that they seized at the home of Jason Baldwin.</p><p id = "prosecution">[2103] Is it your testimony that if any person wears a black tee shirt, is that a factor that you consider in determining if this case has trappings of occultism? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2104] A: The prior dress code that the individual uses is an indicator, yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2105] Q: Are you aware that our local university's colors are black and red? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2106] A: (SHRUGS) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2107] Q: And you're also aware that the Jonesboro High's colors are black and gold? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2108] A: I have gone on record also saying that just because they wear a shirt like that doesn't make them the next Manson. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2109] Q: How many of the cases that you have investigated in which the determination was made that they had trappings of occultism in which the defendants wore black t-shirts? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2110] A: You're asking specific numbers, sir? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2111] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2112] A: I cannot give you a specific number. I get asked that question and people send me pictures privately, parents do, whatever. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2113] Q: Backing up to the picture over here, State's Exhibit 111. In the research that you conducted, are you aware that this picture came from a skating magazine? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2114] A: Source was not told to me. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2115] Q: I'm sure you looked at the back of this photograph, "Skater parks. Your 1991 tour guide." </p><p id = "prosecution">[2116] A: No sir, I was not given the back. Nor was I given the note inside. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2117] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2118] PRICE: Alright, judge, we certainly did not stipulate to the introduction of this particular note. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2119] FOGLEMAN: I didn't know it was there either. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2120] PRICE: I know, ah -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2121] THE WITNESS: I think -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2122] PRICE: (Inaudible) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2123] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2124] Q: Earlier you testified about a quote from, I believe, Alistair Crawley or Crowley -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2125] A: C-r-o-w-l-e-y.

Are you aware that the West Memphis Police Department asked my client how he thought the murders might have occurred? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2129] A: No sir, I'm not aware. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2130] Q: Are you aware that the West Memphis Police Department asked approximately 200 other individuals how they thought the murders might have occurred? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2131] A: I'm not aware of that, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2132] Q: The fact that there was no pattern to the placement of the bodies out at the crime scene -- I mean, is that a factor -- if the bodies were placed in a pattern would that be a factor you would consider? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2133] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2134] Q: Okay. But the fact that the bodies were not placed in a pattern then that's a factor you did not consider? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2135] A: You were looking down when you asked that, counselor. Are you suggesting that they were not in a pattern when they were found? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2136] Q: Let me rephrase this. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2137] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2138] Q: Did the crime scene indicate to you that the boys were laid out in a line or in a unique manner? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2139] A: I sus -- By the way they were tied up, I can only suspect that, okay. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2140] Q: Were you aware that you specifically asked that question on January 27, 1994 to detective Ridge of the West Memphis Police Department? And he answered, "No pattern to the placement of the bodies -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2141] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2142] Q: -- "except the placement in the water." </p><p id = "prosecution">[2143] A: Yeah. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2144] Q: Did you also ask detective Ridge "Was there any natural substance in any way laid out in a pattern?" I believe that was question number 4. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2145] A: You got that -- could you bring it up so that I can -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2146] Q: Sure. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2147] A: -- take a look at it, counselor.

That you asked detective Ridge? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2151] A: "Were there any indicators of a slab or a log or device present at the scene." </p><p id = "prosecution">[2152] Q: Okay, and he answered number 6, "No slab or log was found to be in the area."

Do you know? </p><p id = "defense">[2231] A: I was in Bryn's (?) I can't really remember exactly. </p><p id = "defense">[2232] Q: You don't know, do you? </p><p id = "defense">[2233] A: Not right now, but I knew at the time. </p><p id = "defense">[2234] Q: Now, if you're trying to make a determination that it being in a secluded area is important, doesn't it stand to reason that you wanna know how close you are to other things? How close you are to a home, to a business? </p><p id = "defense">[2235] A: I was, counselor, in a case in -- </p><p id = "defense">[2236] Q: That's not -- </p><p id = "defense">[2237] A: -- Boston which was right beside a church or a school, but they never saw it either. </p><p id = "defense">[2238] Q: That's not my question. My question is, if you're trying to make -- if you're basing your opinion on the fact that it's a secluded area -- </p><p id = "defense">[2239] A: Yes. </p><p id = "defense">[2240] Q: -- isn't it important to know how close it is to a residence or a business? </p><p id = "defense">[2241] A: I think in Mr. Ridge's report to me it was there. </p><p id = "defense">[2242] Q: That's not my question. Is it important -- for the third time -- is it important in determining whether you're in a secluded area to know how close the nearest residence -- </p><p id = "defense">[2243] A: Yes. </p><p id = "defense">[2244] Q: -- or the nearest business, but you don't know that, do you? </p><p id = "defense">[2245] A: I was told by -- I think it was in his report -- of Bryn's -- how close it was. </p><p id = "defense">[2246] Q: But you don't know, do you? </p><p id = "defense">[2247] A: No sir. </p><p id = "defense">[2248] Q: Do you have an opinion about where the blood went? Or you don't know, do you? </p><p id = "defense">[2249] A: No. </p><p id = "defense">[2250] Q: Don't know? </p><p id = "defense">[2251] A: I do not in this case know where the blood went because they have not told me. </p><p id = "defense">[2252] Q: Now, if there was testimony in this case that these boys were killed somewhere else -- </p><p id = "defense">[2253] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[2254] Q: -- that they were taken, tied up and gagged -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2255] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, that assumes facts that aren't in evidence for him to say there was testimony that they were killed somewhere else. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2256] FORD: Let me ask a hypothetical question the way Mr. Fogleman did. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2257] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, that isn't what he said. He said if there was testimony. My hypothetical included testimony that there's actually been. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2258] THE COURT: If you're going to form a hypothetical, it is going to have to be based upon facts that are in evidence. </p><p id = "defense">[2259] FORD: Or may be presented in evidence. </p><p id = "defense">[2260] THE COURT: Or may be presented in evidence. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2261] DAVIS: Your Honor, may we approach. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2262] THE COURT: Yeah. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2263] (A BENCH CONFERENCE OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE JURY) </p><p id = "defense">[2264] FORD: Peretti gave an opinion on possibilities -- </p><p id = "defense">[2265] THE COURT: -- But that's not testimony. </p><p id = "defense">[2266] FORD: Yes, he did. He gave his opinion, your Honor. He gave his opinion that in his opinion these homicides occurred somewhere other than at the scene. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2267] FOGLEMAN: No, he did not. </p><p id = "defense">[2268] FORD: Yes, he did. </p><p id = "defense">[2269] THE COURT: No, he didn't. </p><p id = "defense">[2270] FORD: Yes, he did. </p><p id = "defense">[2271] THE COURT: He just said it was possible. </p><p id = "defense">[2272] FORD: Well, that's an opinion. That's an opinion. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2273] FOGLEMAN: Show me where he said that. </p><p id = "defense">[2274] FORD: Will I have a chance to read it? </p><p id = "defense">[2275] PRICE: (Inaudible) copy. </p><p id = "defense">[2276] THE COURT: You're not going to find it in there. </p><p id = "defense">[2277] FORD: I can't read all that hundred and some odd pages right now and find it, but I know that he gave that opinion. </p><p id = "defense">[2278] (?): Keep your voice down. </p><p id = "defense">[2279] FORD: He gave his opinion that it could have happened in one of three places -- </p><p id = "defense">[2280] (?): Keep your voice down. </p><p id = "defense">[2281] FORD: -- in the water, at the bank or somewhere else, and of those three the most plausible was somewhere else. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2282] FOGLEMAN: I think that was your testimony. </p><p id = "defense">[2283] FORD: That was his testimony. </p><p id = "defense">[2284] THE COURT: No. </p><p id = "defense">[2285] (?): Ask another question and we'll find it (Inaudible) </p><p id = "defense">[2286] FORD: May we look at that so we can read it? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2287] DAVIS: If you wanna find that area for me -- </p><p id = "defense">[2288] FORD: Yeah that's what Robin's gonna look for while I ask him some other questions, or do you wanna keep that a secret? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2289] DAVIS: I'm going to keep this.

Can we take a break since he won't let us look at his copy to get a copy of it? </p><p id = "defense">[2291] THE COURT: You can get all the copies you want, but we're not taking a break now. Let's move along. </p><p id = "defense">[2292] FORD: Your Honor, I can't question this witness until I have the answer to that question. </p><p id = "defense">[2293] THE COURT: Until you have what answer? </p><p id = "defense">[2294] FORD: I believe Doctor Peretti gave the opinion that of those three possibilities the most probable was that it happened somewhere else. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2295] DAVIS: Here's the area where you were questioning him (inaudible) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2296] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2297] THE COURT: What you're trying to -- </p><p id = "defense">[2298] FORD: There's the question there -- </p><p id = "defense">[2299] (Multiple voice - unintelligible) </p><p id = "defense">[2300] FORD: Let the judge read it. </p><p id = "defense">[2301] THE COURT: Okay. </p><p id = "defense">[2302] (Pause) </p><p id = "defense">[2303] THE COURT: Okay. I've read it. </p><p id = "defense">[2304] (RETURN TO OPEN COURT) </p><p id = "defense">[2305] Q: If there were testimony in this case that these homicides could have occurred somewhere else -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2306] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, it's the same objection. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2307] THE COURT: Sustained. You wanna come up here and point it out to me? </p><p id = "defense">[2308] FORD: Your Honor, I asked Doctor Peretti the question -- </p><p id = "defense">[2309] (A BENCH CONFERENCE OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE JURY) </p><p id = "defense">[2310] (Whispering) </p><p id = "defense">[2311] FORD: Is this a certified copy of the transcript? First of all, your Honor. (Pause) "I would question that about the blood unless it happened in the water or it happened at some other place." That was his testimony. </p><p id = "defense">[2312] THE COURT: He just said it was possible. </p><p id = "defense">[2313] FORD: And I'm asking him. All I wanna know -- </p><p id = "defense">[2314] THE COURT: Was there any positive, factual testimony that it happened somewhere else? </p><p id = "defense">[2315] FORD: I could -- well, -- do I get to call him back -- </p><p id = "defense">[2316] THE COURT: Are these thing on? </p><p id = "defense">[2317] FORD: Do I get to call him back at the conclusion of my case? </p><p id = "defense">[2318] THE COURT: I guess so. </p><p id = "defense">[2319] FORD: Or do I get to ask him these hypothetical questions now? </p><p id = "defense">[2320] THE COURT: Are you telling me that you have some physical evidence that these murders occurred someplace else? </p><p id = "defense">[2321] FORD: Your Honor, I'm telling you that I believe that there is an argument from this witness right here, Doctor Peretti, that based on his testimony, I can argue to the jury that it could have happened somewhere else. </p><p id = "defense">[2322] THE COURT: Sure. </p><p id = "defense">[2323] FORD: Therefore I'm entitled to -- </p><p id = "defense">[2324] THE COURT: -- but you don't have any facts -- </p><p id = "defense">[2325] FORD: I'm entitled to ask him if he were told that this homicide occurred somewhere else, would that change his opinion that this was an occult killing. I think I'm entitled to ask him that because the jury may very well conclude and agree that yes this happened somewhere else and if that is true, they need to know that his opinion would be different. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2326] DAVIS: That is assuming a fact that is not in evidence. </p><p id = "defense">[2327] FORD: I can't ask him, if this homicide occurred somewhere else, would you have a different opinion? </p><p id = "defense">[2328] THE COURT: I'll let you ask that question. </p><p id = "defense">[2329] (Multiple voices - unintelligible) </p><p id = "defense">[2330] THE COURT: Just like you just asked. </p><p id = "defense">[2331] FORD: Okay. </p><p id = "defense">[2332] (RETURN TO OPEN COURT) </p><p id = "defense">[2333] Q: Doctor -- </p><p id = "defense">[2334] THE COURT: He said he didn't know whether he was supposed to listen or not that's why he turned his back -- </p><p id = "defense">[2335] Q: If this homicide occurred somewhere else -- </p><p id = "defense">[2336] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "defense">[2337] Q: -- other than in these woods, would your opinion that this was an occult killing change? </p><p id = "defense">[2338] A: You're asking me to make an opinion, counselor. </p><p id = "defense">[2339] Q: Absolutely, I sure am -- </p><p id = "defense">[2340] A: And to have that, I would also have to know -- do we know where it happened at? </p><p id = "defense">[2341] Q: If the homicides did occur somewhere else, would your opinion change? </p><p id = "defense">[2342] A: I would have to have a different set of facts. </p><p id = "defense">[2343] Q. So does that mean, yes your opinion would change or, no your opinion would not change? </p><p id = "defense">[2344] A: No, my comment is the same, counselor, as what I've just said to you. I would have to know some more facts. </p><p id = "defense">[2345] Q: Would the likelihood go down if the homicides occurred somewhere else? </p><p id = "defense">[2346] A: It could go up.

If that evidence is wrong, if that evidence is a lie, do you have any other evidence to connect Jason Baldwin to the occult? </p><p id = "defense">[2354] A: I have not seen the reports to know if other people said he was present or not. So the answer would be no. </p><p id = "defense">[2355] Q: The answer is no? </p><p id = "defense">[2356] A: Yeah. </p><p id = "defense">[2357] THE COURT: Anything else? </p><p id = "defense">[2358] PRICE: Yes sir, I've got some redirect. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2359] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I've got -- I think -- I've got one question, your Honor. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2360] THE COURT: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2361] REDIRECT EXAMINATION </p><p id = "prosecution">[2362] BY FOGLEMAN: </p><p id = "prosecution">[2363] Q: The serial killers have been mentioned.
