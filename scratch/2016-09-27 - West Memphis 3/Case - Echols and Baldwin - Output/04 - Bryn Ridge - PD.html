Did you uh - did you participate in the investigation of the disappearance of Michael Moore, Stevie Branch, and Chris Byers?</p><p id = "prosecution">[11] RIDGE: Yes sir, I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[12] FOGLEMAN: And what part did you play in that investigation?</p><p id = "prosecution">[13] RIDGE: Uh - in the search itself and the crime scene.</p><p id = "prosecution">[14] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And what time did you begin uh - searching for the kids yourself?</p><p id = "prosecution">[15] RIDGE: Uh - to the best of my memory, about 7:30 that morning.</p><p id = "prosecution">[16] FOGLEMAN: And um - what areas did you search?</p><p id = "prosecution">[17] RIDGE: Ok. Upon arriving at the station, I was informed of the disappearance of the children uh - reports were that they were in the Robin Hood area and I went to the Robin Hood area, searched that area on foot. Uh - </p><p id = "prosecution">[18] FOGLEMAN: When you say you searched it, what do you mean?</p><p id = "prosecution">[19] RIDGE: Ok. I went into that area. Uh - walking through that area.</p><p id = "prosecution">[20] FOGLEMAN: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[21] RIDGE: And uh - upon arriving in that area, the first person I saw was a Steven Branch who was in the uh - along the ditch near Mayfair -</p><p id = "prosecution">[22] FOGLEMAN: You talking about Stevie's father?</p><p id = "prosecution">[23] RIDGE: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[24] FOGLEMAN: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[25] RIDGE: And then, he was in the area near Mayfair Apartments. There's a pipe there that crosses Ten Mile Bayou, I crossed that pipe. There was a bicycle laying on the north side of that pipe, uh - I walked into the woods, I saw a young man out in the woods hollering for the children. Uh - I looked in -</p><p id = "prosecution">[26] FOGLEMAN: When you say young man, do you know about how old?</p><p id = "prosecution">[27] RIDGE: I would say 15 to 16 years old.</p><p id = "prosecution">[28] FOGLEMAN: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[29] RIDGE: I looked into the field on the north side of Ten Mile Bayou. There were two young men in that field hollering for the children and uh - looking through the field into the Ten Mile Bayou ditch. And uh - I had a discussion with the young man that was on the bicycle about leaving his bicycle there - somebody were to discover that bicycle, they may think it was a bicycle one of the boys missing owned and it would cause people to converge on an area when there was no reason to believe that the kids were there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[30] FOGLEMAN: Where did you come into contact with this young man?</p><p id = "prosecution">[31] RIDGE: Uh - I was on the northeast side of the area, known as Turtle Hill.</p><p id = "prosecution">[32] FOGLEMAN: Ok. Were you in the woods?</p><p id = "prosecution">[33] RIDGE: Yes, in the woods.</p><p id = "prosecution">[34] FOGLEMAN: Alright. If you could, step down and refer to the state's exhibit 13 and if you could show us the approximate area of where you had this conversation with the young man.</p><p id = "prosecution">[35] RIDGE: Ok. This is the pipe that crosses the bayou, this area right here is a heap of dirt that was uh - made when the ditches were dug out and this is known as Turtle Hill. When I crossed the hill on this trail, I was in this area, saw this young man out in this wooded area searching. Uh - he was calling for the kids. He came back to me, he told me he was looking for the kids, this is where I talked with him. He said that he left his bicycle over here by the pipe, it had a flat on it. And that uh - I had the conversation with him and told him that he needed to take the bicycle and keep it with him.</p><p id = "prosecution">[36] FOGLEMAN: While we're in this area and while you're in this area, describe for the jury the terrain from the end of uh - West McAuley down to the pipe and then from the pipe up.</p><p id = "prosecution">[37] RIDGE: Ok. All of this area, there's about a 20 foot - 30 foot wide area here, just nothing but weeds. Uh - they vary in height from waist and chest high to some of it would be over your head. Back to the east of that area, there are trees that would be 20 - 30 foot high, uh - circumference of maybe a foot and a half. They're just - they're spread out all through this area for about a quarter of a mile down to the next street. Uh - there are trails where um - kids ride bicycles, 3-wheelers, go carts. Uh - then there are these trails here, when you cross -</p><p id = "prosecution">[38] FOGLEMAN: Let me stop you.</p><p id = "prosecution">[39] RIDGE: - the bayou.</p><p id = "prosecution">[40] FOGLEMAN: Dead end of West McAuley to the pipe, is it - I mean, describe it - is it level? Do you go up hill, down hill to get to the pipe?</p><p id = "prosecution">[41] RIDGE: Oh, from the end of the pipe, you'll be level, you'll go up a small hill, and then you'll start going down on the hill to the pipe.</p><p id = "prosecution">[42] FOGLEMAN: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[43] RIDGE: Uh - it's sort of uneven terrain. </p><p id = "prosecution">[44] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And approximately how much drop would you say from the pipe to the level ground?</p><p id = "prosecution">[45] RIDGE: Probably, an estimate - 5 to 6 foot.</p><p id = "prosecution">[46] FOGLEMAN: Ok. Alright. And on the other side, do you walk off the pipe and it's just flat or what?</p><p id = "prosecution">[47] RIDGE: No sir. You would start immediately going up the far bank. And it's - go up to top of Turtle Hill, which would be another 5 or 6 foot above that. And of course the trail - unless you get up to the level of the surrounding land, then this trail would pretty well flatten out and go into the back of Blue Beacon. Then you have the trail that went over the top of Turtle Hill and goes into this area, which is flattened out.</p><p id = "prosecution">[48] FOGLEMAN: Now, let me direct your attention to state's exhibit 101, and if you could uh - show the jury in this particular aerial photo - 101, uh - what areas did you search? Uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[49] RIDGE: Ok. When I first got to Robin Hood Hills or Robin Hood Park that day, I parked here. Ok. I walked through these trails to the Ten Mile Bayou, and then I walked the trails down through here which these are just -</p><p id = "prosecution">[50] (tape flipped)</p><p id = "prosecution">[51] RIDGE: - got my 3- wheeler actually. Um - actually, the first thing I did - excuse me - is I come back across the pipe and I'd go back like I'm going back to my vehicle, but rather than turn and come down these trails, I go the same trail - runs off of this area, an area known to me as Devil's Den and it's just another creek that runs into the Ten Mile Bayou - then I started searching through all these vines and weeds and trees in this area and make my way back to my police unit. After getting to my police unit, I go to my residence, pick up my uh - 3-wheeler and then I began searching on my 3-wheeler.</p><p id = "prosecution">[52] FOGLEMAN: Where did you search on your 3-wheeler?</p><p id = "prosecution">[53] RIDGE: Ok. I parked here and got on my 3-wheeler going back to this area, coming out here with my 3-wheeler, then I go down the east side of this ditch into that field, go around the edge of that field and this is - there's a lot of water and what have you from the recent rains in this area - and go all the way down to 18th street, which is about uh - 300 yards, maybe, on to the east. Then I cross the expressway on Ingram Avenue, I go north uh - past the dog track, cross the railroad track and start making my way back to the west. Uh - I go to the area around Lakeshore Trailer Park, all the fields on the backside looking for bicycle tracks, small footprints, anything - any sign would have been there -</p><p id = "prosecution">[54] FOGLEMAN: Alright, let me stop you now.</p><p id = "prosecution">[55] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[56] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, after you searched and searched and searched, did you receive some word that you needed to return to the woods there by Blue Beacon?</p><p id = "prosecution">[57] RIDGE: Yes sir, I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[58] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And about what time was that, approximately?</p><p id = "prosecution">[59] RIDGE: A few minutes after 1:00. Uh - 1:15 to 1:20 is a guess, an estimate.</p><p id = "prosecution">[60] FOGLEMAN: And did you return to that area?</p><p id = "prosecution">[61] RIDGE: Yes sir, I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[62] FOGLEMAN: Alright. You can retake the stand. </p><p id = "prosecution">[63] (mumbles)</p><p id = "prosecution">[64] FOGLEMAN: Let me show you uh - state's exhibits 14, 15, and 16 - ask if you can identify those.</p><p id = "prosecution">[65] RIDGE: Yes sir, I can.</p><p id = "prosecution">[66] FOGLEMAN: Those photographs fairly and accurately portray the scene as it appeared to you at that time?</p><p id = "prosecution">[67] RIDGE: Yes sir, they do.</p><p id = "prosecution">[68] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we would offer state's exhibits 14, 15, and 16.</p><p id = "prosecution">[69] PRICE: No objection.</p><p id = "defense">[70] FORD: No objection.</p><p id = "defense">[71] THE COURT: It may be received without objection.</p><p id = "prosecution">[72] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, may the witness step down and describe to the jury?</p><p id = "prosecution">[73] THE COURT: Yes, he may.</p><p id = "prosecution">[74] (mumbles)</p><p id = "prosecution">[75] FOGLEMAN: I believe it's going to be 14, 15, and 16. If you would take the corner Detective and describe uh - beginning with - to the left, which would be 14, 15, and 16 - you describe -</p><p id = "prosecution">[76] RIDGE: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[77] FOGLEMAN: - what's shown in the photographs.</p><p id = "prosecution">[78] RIDGE: This is an aerial photograph of an area known as the crime scene - Robin Hood Woods. It's from the north looking to the south. This is West McAuley, this is the area known as Mayfair Apartments, this is the water impound area that would be for Blue Beacon which would be lower in the picture, uh - this street is W.E. Catt, this is a trail that comes off the end of West McAuley - comes down to the pipe, it also has a branch that runs back into the area known as the other Robin Hood Woods, back in that area where all the trails are that 3-wheelers, 4-wheelers, and bicycles are on. Ok. The pipe crosses Ten Mile Bayou and you've got the trail that comes up the side of the bank - this is the trail that goes across the area, which is just a heap of dirt which is known as Turtle Hill. The trail will either split and go that way, which leads into the area of the crime scene, which lays right in this area - or the trail continues straight forward and goes into the back-end of Blue Beacon. Uh - this photograph is a photograph of -</p><p id = "prosecution">[79] FOGLEMAN: 15?</p><p id = "prosecution">[80] RIDGE: Yes sir, exhibit 15. Uh - this is 7th street. It's a picture from the west looking east - it's actually a little bit southeast. Uh - here again is West McAuley, the apartments known as Mayfair, W.E. Catt, the pipe crosses Ten Mile Bayou - here is the pipe that crosses Ten Mile Bayou, this area is the area of the crime scene, the Robin Hood Woods - all of this area here where the bicycle trails are and everything are known as Robin Hood Woods, as well as this area of Robin Hood Woods - Robin Hood Hills. Uh - this is 40 - 55 expressway. 55 travels on to the east and south here at the split - this is the split where 40 travels to Memphis, going a little bit north and east. Uh - this is 7th street, this is 76 truck stop, this is Luv's truck stop, again this is the Blue Beacon, and this water impoundment that you can see here. Uh - this is a picture from the south -</p><p id = "prosecution">[81] FOGLEMAN: Referring to exhibit 16?</p><p id = "prosecution">[82] RIDGE: Exhibit 16 - looking to the north, a little bit east of north. Here is 7th street, uh - here is West McAuley, the apartments known as Mayfair, Robin Hood Woods here and these trails, and again this is 55 - 40 expressway, the Blue Beacon, 76 truck stop, this wood line that you can see coming down through the middle of it - that is the Ten Mile Bayou. </p><p id = "prosecution">[83] FOGLEMAN: You can retake the stand, Officer. </p><p id = "prosecution">[84] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[85] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now when you get to the um - area of the woods by Blue Beacon, uh - what did you find there?</p><p id = "prosecution">[86] RIDGE: Ok. I found that Mike Allen was on the scene, a Sergeant with the police department. Lt. Diane Hester on the scene, who's a Detective with the police department. Inspector Gitchell, and I believe Stan Burch and uh - Detective Bill Durham were there. </p><p id = "prosecution">[87] FOGLEMAN: And after arriving, what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[88] RIDGE: Ok. I was informed of some shoes that were found floating in the water and that Mike Allen had gotten into the water to see about the retrieval of those shoes - see if they were those of the uh - victims - and while he was doing so, he found the body of one of the victims.</p><p id = "prosecution">[89] (long pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[90] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[91] FORD: Are you offering these?</p><p id = "prosecution">[92] FOGLEMAN: I'm getting ready to.</p><p id = "defense">[93] FORD: Your Honor, he's going to offer some photographs, we would like to make a record out of the presence of the jury.</p><p id = "defense">[94] THE COURT: Let me see 'em.</p><p id = "prosecution">[95] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we're trying to keep 'em in order, if you don't mind.</p><p id = "prosecution">[96] THE COURT: Alright ladies and gentlemen, uh - with the admonition not to discuss the case, you may step into the jury room for a 5 to 10 minute recess. I'll call ya back in when we're through.</p><p id = "prosecution">[97] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[98] PRICE: Approach the bench? </p><p id = "defense">[99] FORD: Your Honor, if we could start with the photographs, um - I've had some - there're gonna be some - you know, I just want to make sure that my objection in all hearings outside the presence of the jury are not to be filmed or recorded or subjected to any cameras in this stage of the game and I want to make sure that the press is aware of that. Because it's vaguely printed and it could be read -</p><p id = "defense">[100] THE COURT: Just a minute, let me finish this.</p><p id = "defense">[101] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[102] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[103] THE COURT: Mike, is this more than one person?</p><p id = "defense">[104] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[105] THE COURT: Huh? You want Pat to sign the rest of these?</p><p id = "defense">[106] (unidentified) : I just need you to sign where my secretary says these things are appropriate...Yeah.</p><p id = "prosecution">[107] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, what I was gonna bring up, there are some uh - perspective witnesses of the state who are under 18 and their parents have requested not only that they not be filmed, but they would prefer that their names not be in the paper and we would like the Court to request the news media not to print the names of those witnesses that are under 18.</p><p id = "prosecution">[108] THE COURT: Well, I can request it, but I don't know whether it'll do a bit of good.</p><p id = "prosecution">[109] FOGLEMAN: I understand that Your Honor and that's all that we're asking is that the press to be requested not to print the names -</p><p id = "prosecution">[110] THE COURT: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[111] FOGLEMAN: - of witnesses under 18. </p><p id = "defense">[112] THE COURT: Ok. Did you have some understanding, Mr. Ford, with the cameras that no pictures were to be taken of no-one in Denno Hearings in the courtroom?</p><p id = "defense">[113] FORD: That's correct, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[114] THE COURT: Well, if that was the understanding, then I expect you to live up to the understanding.</p><p id = "defense">[115] FORD: Alright, Your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[116] THE COURT: Alright. Let the rec -</p><p id = "defense">[117] (unidentified) : I can't hear you, Judge.</p><p id = "defense">[118] THE COURT: Well, maybe I had this off. Mr. Ford indicated that he had some understanding with the um - um - cameras, still and otherwise, that they would not be utilized during any hearing in the courtroom - was that your understanding?</p><p id = "defense">[119] (mumbling - talking over)</p><p id = "defense">[120] THE COURT: What?</p><p id = "defense">[121] FORD: Your Honor, it was my agreement that we would not - we would withdraw our objections to the electronic media - the cameras, the recording devices, any still cameras or moving picture cameras, we would waive th - we would withdraw our objections provided that there would be no recording of any testimony or conversations during the hearings outside the presence of the jury and that there be no photographs or film taken during those as well.</p><p id = "defense">[122] THE COURT: If that was the understanding, then that's what we'll have. Alright, let's proceed gentlemen. </p><p id = "prosecution">[123] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I didn't get the - did the members of the press get my request?</p><p id = "prosecution">[124] (unidentified) : No. </p><p id = "prosecution">[125] (unidentified) : No. </p><p id = "prosecution">[126] FOGLEMAN: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[127] THE COURT: It was requested that the witnesses that are under the age of 18 years - I don't know who they'll be, I must - who are they, John?</p><p id = "prosecution">[128] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, there's several. If they need case by case, I can give it to 'em. Witnesses under 18, their parents - if possible - would like for their names not to be used - I mean, it's a request. </p><p id = "prosecution">[129] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[130] (unidentified) : Not a problem.</p><p id = "prosecution">[131] FOGLEMAN: Ok. </p><p id = "prosecution">[132] THE COURT: I'm not entering the order, it's just being requested. Do whatever you wanna do - what you're gonna do, I guess would be the -</p><p id = "defense">[133] (unidentified) : Your Honor, Mr. Ford's motion in regards to the recording of - what's going to happen if -</p><p id = "defense">[134] THE COURT: This is called a - well, I - a Denno Hearing, it's a hearing out of the presence of the jury, uh - to review these photographs of - I mean, you can report whatever you want of it, but he doesn't want it photographed.</p><p id = "defense">[135] (unidentified) : Oh, photographed - ok. </p><p id = "defense">[136] THE COURT: Or recorded. Now, I don't know if you had that same understanding with uh - Homebox Office or not. I guess it applies to them as well. </p><p id = "defense">[137] FORD: Yeah, we had that with all media, Your Honor. That is my condition.</p><p id = "defense">[138] THE COURT: Alright. Then that's my understanding then. Alright, let's proceed gentlemen. You handed me uh - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 photographs. Exhibits 39, 36, 20, 17, 35, and 24. </p><p id = "prosecution">[139] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I might as well go ahead and - these are the ones that we had before about the condition of the bank, but they do have one of the victims in it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[140] THE COURT: What - give the exhibit number for the court reporter. It's 26?</p><p id = "prosecution">[141] FOGLEMAN: 26, 23, 22.</p><p id = "prosecution">[142] THE COURT: That'll be 9 photographs - alright. What is your objection?</p><p id = "defense">[143] FORD: Your Honor, we're objecting number 1 to uh - can we turn these microphones off, Your Honor? That's not gonna -</p><p id = "defense">[144] THE COURT: No. Go ahead. </p><p id = "defense">[145] FORD: It was our understanding that -</p><p id = "defense">[146] THE COURT: This microphone is my PA system. Those are suppose to be off, except for the court reporter's. Is that correct - they're off? </p><p id = "defense">[147] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[148] THE COURT: No.</p><p id = "defense">[149] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[150] THE COURT: Ok. I want the ones that go to the van off.</p><p id = "defense">[151] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[152] THE COURT: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[153] FORD: Your Honor, first, I would like for them to establish what relevance there is to those photographs - what the proposition is. And once they have determined that, Your Honor, I can - at that point, make an objection. But I feel until there's a um - a proper um - foundation that's been laid to the introduction of the photographs that the proposition once they're introduced is identified by this witness that I'm not able to make specific objections.</p><p id = "prosecution">[154] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I can take care of that. Your Honor, the - let me get this photograph - Your Honor, the first 3, which are 22, 23, and 26 are to show the condition of the bank. Uh - they show the - how it's slicked off -</p><p id = "defense">[155] FORD: That is ridiculous.</p><p id = "prosecution">[156] FOGLEMAN: - cleaned off, the bank -</p><p id = "defense">[157] FORD: That's ridiculous.</p><p id = "prosecution">[158] FOGLEMAN: - and to show the, uh - we don't have photographs to portray, that it don't have uh - that victim in the picture. Exhibit 39 is to show the recovery of uh - Michael Moore, it also has the stick with the clothes on it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[159] THE COURT: That right there?</p><p id = "prosecution">[160] FOGLEMAN: Yeah. 36 -</p><p id = "prosecution">[161] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[162] FOGLEMAN: - is the photograph of the recovery of uh - I think that's - I believe that's Stevie Branch. Not only shows his recovery from the water but also the condition of the surface of the water - the debris in the water. Exhibit 20 uh - shows the recovery of Stevie Branch with uh - again, the condition of the water and also the condition of the bank, which would be the west bank where there's a flattened off spot where his body was recovered. Exhibit 17 is uh - Stevie Branch, it shows the ligatures and the manner in which it's tied. In addition to uh - the uh - bank and the wound to his face. Exhibit 35 shows the recovery of Chris Byers uh - it also shows the condition of the surface of the water, the debris and exhibit 24 shows the ligatures on Chris Byers and uh - his general condition and also uh - the least offensive uh - photograph of Chris Byers.</p><p id = "prosecution">[163] THE COURT: You had a whole stack of other photographs that I didn't allow in. Where are those?</p><p id = "defense">[164] FORD: Well Your Honor, we're in a separate trial here today. We're not - this is not, you know -</p><p id = "defense">[165] THE COURT: Mr. Ford, I understand that. </p><p id = "defense">[166] FORD: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[167] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, the court reporter has those photographs that we proffered and I don't know exactly how to do this but we hadn't had 'em - I would like to proffer the same photographs that we proffered in the other trial in this trial, with the understanding they wouldn't be admitted, but for purpose of showing the photographs that we proffered.</p><p id = "prosecution">[168] THE COURT: Alright. That'll be allowed. Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[169] FORD: Your Honor, state's exhibit number 22, 23, and 26 were offered for the proposition of establishing the condition of the bank. </p><p id = "prosecution">[170] FOGLEMAN: You might also add, they show the ligatures on Michael Moore.</p><p id = "defense">[171] FORD: Alright. First of all Your Honor, if they're trying to show the ligatures, they're trying to show the condition of the bank, then they're trying to show his injuries - one will do. Three, I don't see how they show - one shows more bank than the other one. This one doesn't hardly show any of the bank. That would be exhibit number 22, which has Officer Ridge, a green leaf and the body - no-one's looking at any bank in that photograph. State's exhibit number 23 and state's exhibit number 26, Your Honor, I submit that is that is offered for the proposition to establish the condition of the bank, that that is not a fair and accurate representation of what that bank should appear like in it's totality if they're trying to establish that this bank has been scrubbed off, slicked off because there's not enough bank there to even have the slightest bit of understanding. Secondly Your Honor, they're duplicative and there's no need to introduce both of those. I submit, Your Honor, that not one of those photographs is relevant to establish the proposition as to the condition of the bank.</p><p id = "defense">[172] DAVIDSON: We would join in that motion also, Your Honor, all these motions.</p><p id = "defense">[173] FORD: And lastly, Your Honor, I would ask how those are necessary in order to help the witness explain in his testimony.</p><p id = "defense">[174] DAVIDSON: One further thing I would like to add, Your Honor, is that uh - it's my understanding that there is a video of the bank that would depict this area without having the inflammatory uh - the bodies in there and uh - there are portions of that video that could certainly be shown to show the same thing.</p><p id = "prosecution">[175] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I don't believe the video at all shows the condition of this bank, where you can look at this picture of the bank and see the swirls in the mud, you can see the grass bent down covered with mud, and you can see the uh - uh - the slickness, general appearance of the bank.</p><p id = "prosecution">[176] THE COURT: Alright. Are you offering them in all to show the condition of the body, the wounds sustained in addition?</p><p id = "prosecution">[177] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we would offer to show the condition of the body as far as the ligatures and uh - the general condition of the body, but frankly the main purpose is the condition of the bank, but we would also offer for those other purposes as well.</p><p id = "prosecution">[178] THE COURT: Did you have any other pictures of bank without the bodies being placed on the bank?</p><p id = "prosecution">[179] FOGLEMAN: Not of that bank, I don't believe.

The issue -</p><p id = "defense">[235] FORD: I think that's one of the issues, Your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[236] THE COURT: - is whether or not the photograph aids and assists him in - there's a descriptive in what he saw and observed and if it accurately portrays the condition of the body at the time he retrieved it from the ditch - that's the question. </p><p id = "defense">[237] FORD: Does it aid - do - do you need this to properly testify?

This is exhibit 39, which is an enlargement of a Polaroid photograph. This photograph is that of myself - Detective Ridge, and Detective Sergeant Mike Allen removing the body of Michael Moore from the ditch where he was located. </p><p id = "prosecution">[282] FOGLEMAN: Now also in this photograph, what is this item right here?</p><p id = "prosecution">[283] RIDGE: This item is a stick that - when Sergeant Allen told me he had located the body and pointed out the area where the body had been located, I was up on the west bank which is a high bank. Ok. I proceeded to the north, come down into the creek, and began walking down into the creek and searching that creek. In searching the creek, I would start in the waterline on one side, rake all the way through and get back on the other side - see if anything was there before I would walk through that area, which could possibly destroy any evidence. Ok. I had walked approximately 10 feet and gotten almost to that body when this stick was uh - dislodged and when it came floating up out of the water uh - this shirt was discovered, and the shirt was wrapped around the end of the stick -</p><p id = "prosecution">[284] FOGLEMAN: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[285] RIDGE: - and all that was jabbed down into the mud in the bottom of the ditch.</p><p id = "prosecution">[286] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now when you say it was dislodged when you were walking toward that area, what if anything could you see about that stick?</p><p id = "prosecution">[287] RIDGE: Just the end of the stick sticking up out of the water.</p><p id = "prosecution">[288] FOGLEMAN: Ok. And uh - when you say you were walking that way, were you doing this - or what were you doing?</p><p id = "prosecution">[289] RIDGE: I was searching the ditch as I was going. </p><p id = "prosecution">[290] FOGLEMAN: Alright. You talking about inch by inch?</p><p id = "prosecution">[291] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[292] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And describe that process for the jury.</p><p id = "prosecution">[293] RIDGE: Ok. The ditch being approximately just over the knee deep in that area, uh - I would take - at the waterline - and rake my hand all the way around the mud there, keeping my hand at the edge of the mud all the way through from one side to the other. When that was completed, I would do the same thing and go back to the other side, uh - being careful to overlap my - the same area so that nothing was missed. And I would go through that as I went through. Like I said, approximately 10 foot before coming to the body.</p><p id = "prosecution">[294] FOGLEMAN: And after you discovered Michael Moore, what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[295] RIDGE: Ok. The body was placed on the east bank, just above where he was located. And then, we began the process of removing those items that were floating in the water, uh - including the shirt, pants, shoes, and that type activity.</p><p id = "prosecution">[296] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And then what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[297] RIDGE: Ok. The body - the search continued in the same manner all the way down through the creek. Uh - going through uh - there was a limb laying over in the creek that had actually uh - shoes were floating and had come up against the limb - in flowing water when something comes against a limb or debris or whatever, that's where it stops, and that's the way we found these shoes. Uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[298] FOGLEMAN: And how was the water - what was the flow?</p><p id = "prosecution">[299] RIDGE: It was a very slow flow. Uh - above this area, has a trickle. Uh - if you can imagine, there would be something like 2 gallons a minute would come through this trickle of water. Then it would go into this area, which a 10 foot area - might be 150 gallons. So the 2 gallons a minute that would come into this area would make this a very slow current in this area - where it might have been uh - a foot every 10 seconds above that area, it was maybe a foot in every minute and a half or two minutes in this -</p><p id = "defense">[300] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, we would object -</p><p id = "prosecution">[301] FOGLEMAN: I would just estimate on it -</p><p id = "prosecution">[302] (talking over)</p><p id = "defense">[303] DAVIDSON: Detective giving the opinion on the water flow - the gallons per minute, unless he's qualified to give that opinion. Thank you, Your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[304] THE COURT: Alright, I'll sustain the objection.</p><p id = "prosecution">[305] FOGLEMAN: Water was moving slow?</p><p id = "prosecution">[306] RIDGE: Very slow.</p><p id = "prosecution">[307] FOGLEMAN: Thank you. Alright. And as you moved uh - along doing this search, uh - how - well, just tell the jury what you found.</p><p id = "prosecution">[308] RIDGE: Ok. At - near the body - where Michael Moore was found, the water was devoid, or there was an absence of any debris floating in that particular area. There was very little, if any, in that area. As you got lower in the stream, there was more debris. Uh - including the shoes floating, the clothes floating, and what have you - the boy scout cap. The further you went, the more debris you ran into.</p><p id = "prosecution">[309] FOGLEMAN: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[310] RIDGE: Going downstream.</p><p id = "prosecution">[311] FOGLEMAN: And then as you got further downstream, what else did you find?</p><p id = "prosecution">[312] RIDGE: Ok. Approximately 25 foot - later measured as 27 foot, uh - below the body of Michael Moore, I -</p><p id = "prosecution">[313] FOGLEMAN: That's downstream?</p><p id = "prosecution">[314] RIDGE: Yes sir. I found the body of Stevie Branch. Uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[315] FOGLEMAN: Now I want to refer your attention to exhibit 36. </p><p id = "prosecution">[316] RIDGE: This is me uh - discovering the body of Stevie Branch. In the water you can see the obvious debris - how much more debris there is here than there was in the picture where Michael Moore was located. Um - I was raising him up out of the water at that point.</p><p id = "prosecution">[317] FOGLEMAN: Let me refer you to state's exhibit 20.</p><p id = "prosecution">[318] RIDGE: State's exhibit 20 is me actually removing the body from the water and preparing to move him to the bank - lay him on the bank above where he was located. Again, in the water you can see the debris. This is Detective Stan Burch who assisted - Stan and Detective Sergeant Mike Allen. </p><p id = "prosecution">[319] FOGLEMAN: State's exhibit 17.</p><p id = "prosecution">[320] RIDGE: This is uh - me laying the body of Stevie Branch on the bank above where he was located. Uh - this area of the bank here is an absence of leaves, as in the surrounding area you can see leaves, sticks, grass, and what have you. In that particular area, there was no - there was an area of - where absence of leaves.</p><p id = "prosecution">[321] FOGLEMAN: Which bank is this, we're talking about?</p><p id = "prosecution">[322] RIDGE: This is on the west bank. </p><p id = "prosecution">[323] FOGLEMAN: Alright. As oppose to where Michael Moore was, which was on the east bank - ok. Alright. And then after um - recovering Stevie and putting him on the bank, what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[324] RIDGE: Well, after observing the injuries of Stevie as he was removed from the water and I laid him on the bank, he had some severe cuts to the facial area uh - on the left side, uh - he was tied with ligatures, right hand to right foot, left hand to left foot, uh - his penis had a reddish - dark reddish bruise like color to it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[325] FOGLEMAN: And then after you did that, what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[326] RIDGE: I continued to search downstream from that area, as in the previous search.</p><p id = "prosecution">[327] FOGLEMAN: And what did you find?</p><p id = "prosecution">[328] RIDGE: The body of Christopher Byers. </p><p id = "prosecution">[329] FOGLEMAN: Show you state's exhibit 35 - exhibit that to describe.</p><p id = "prosecution">[330] RIDGE: This is uh - me recovering uh - the body of Chris Byers from the water - the creek.

Just at the bottom of this picture would be the area where Michael Moore was located. Traveling downstream would be - or at the top of the picture - the body of Stevie Branch was located, in an area just behind this tree. And the body of Christopher Byers was located just below stream -</p><p id = "prosecution">[349] FOGLEMAN: Let me interrupt you -</p><p id = "prosecution">[350] (talking over)</p><p id = "prosecution">[351] FOGLEMAN: Let me interrupt you a minute. I want to refer you to state's exhibit 11. The leaning tree on the bank, uh - is on - is that depicted in that photograph?</p><p id = "prosecution">[352] RIDGE: Yes sir. That's this picture here - of this tree.</p><p id = "prosecution">[353] FOGLEMAN: Ok. Go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[354] RIDGE: Ok. In this picture also, you can see the debris, the body of - the first body, of Michael Moore was located here. The debris that's floating in the stream downstream was where his body was located. This is the limb that was in the water that -</p><p id = "prosecution">[355] PRICE: If you could refer to the -</p><p id = "prosecution">[356] THE COURT: Refer to the exhibit number, I don't think -</p><p id = "prosecution">[357] RIDGE: Exhibit number 18 uh - is a photograph of the shoes. There are 2 shoes - actually 3 shoes floating in the water.

A uh - this is a photograph of those items, where they were recovered. Uh - here's a - the stick with the shirt wrapped around it that was dislodged and floated to the top, as I was coming to the body of Michael Moore. Also, a pair of pants that was located in the mud just beside the body of Michael Moore. It was down at the bottom of the creek and I recovered them as I was recovering the body from - of Michael Moore, from the water. Uh - you can see the shoe that's in the previous picture that was floating here, the uh - cub scout cap was right here in this area right above that. This is a picture of me removing those shoes from the water. Uh - all this - these pictures are those items just below the body of Michael Moore.

That he saw it himself. And at that point, he then pointed out the areas of the photograph that depicted what he believed to be present.

The defense - I believe it was Mr. Ford, had a number of items blown up and I anticipate - now, I may be wrong in anticipation, but I anticipate that he may be trying to use some documents from the police department to cross examine Detective Ridge on and uh - I noticed, the one that I did catch a glimpse of had West Memphis Police Department stationary and we would ask with the Court's permission to examine those prior to cross examination to make sure that he is - would be examining Detective Ridge about some of Detective Ridge's product and not something that somebody else - or something that would be inadmissible or irrelevant.</p><p id = "defense">[441] FORD: Your Honor, we don't anticipate using any of those - what is mentioned, with respect to uh - Detective Ridge to my knowledge.</p><p id = "defense">[442] THE COURT: Well, I don't want you to cross examine anybody from a written document that's not their own product. </p><p id = "defense">[443] FORD: There won't be none, I won't do that.</p><p id = "defense">[444] THE COURT: It would be hearsay and I would sustain an objection to it so don't attempt to do it. So -</p><p id = "defense">[445] FORD: That's - that'd be - that's quite fine. </p><p id = "defense">[446] THE COURT: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[447] FORD: He doesn't know what it is and I -</p><p id = "defense">[448] THE COURT: Well, I sure don't and I'm telling ya - you can't cross examine someone by a document prepared by someone else.

I think you know that.</p><p id = "defense">[449] FORD: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[450] THE COURT: Alright, anything else?</p><p id = "prosecution">[451] FOGLEMAN: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[452] PRICE: Yes sir, if we could approach for a minute?</p><p id = "prosecution">[453] THE COURT: Well, you can just say it from there, the jury's not in here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[454] PRICE: Alright. That's fine, Judge. Judge, a few moments ago before you came in the courtroom, uh - Phillip Wells, who's actually - I guess, is the Court's liaison, was giving statements to the press, anticipated on Mr. Misskelley's testimony or not. I'd like to know the substance of those conversations and I'd like to know the status of those negotiations.</p><p id = "prosecution">[455] THE COURT: Well, I'll tell ya what Mr. Wells told me in, uh - I guess Mr. Wells - when I asked him to perform that service that you're aware of earlier, that he's just kind of been stuck with it is what it amounts to. Uh - he informed me that he met with uh - Greg Crow, one of the attorneys for Mr. Misskelley - I don't recall if Dan Stidham was there, I don't believe he was according to what Phillip Wells told me. And that they discussed with him the possibility of his testimony and that nothing has been resolved at this time with regard to his potential testimony. I understand that they are talking. That's the best that I can tell ya.</p><p id = "defense">[456] FORD: Your Honor, in light of the fact that Mr. Wells stands in a peculiar position being the Court's liaison, which I believe is the term he is using to the press - Your Honor, we feel that for him to be making remarks to the press about what's going on with respect to witnesses is as if you yourself were making those remarks, Your Honor. And therefore, are impermissible remarks of the Court -</p><p id = "defense">[457] THE COURT: (talking over) I'll tell Mr. Wells to refrain from making any comment to the press in the future. I agree with you.</p><p id = "defense">[458] FORD: Your Honor, we would also ask that the remark that he made this morning - he basically stood at the rail and held a press conference, and we would ask that there be an order issued not to have those items printed because they are -</p><p id = "defense">[459] THE COURT: Well, I can't do that. </p><p id = "defense">[460] FORD: Ok. Your Honor, we just make the record - we feel that those remarks, if printed or aired, are comments by the Court on the evidence in this case.</p><p id = "defense">[461] THE COURT: Uh - (laughter)</p><p id = "defense">[462] PRICE: Well Judge -</p><p id = "defense">[463] THE COURT: I don't go that far, Mr. FORD, at all. In fact, I wasn't aware that Mr. Wells had made a press conference. Now, I'll certainly tell him that he's not to do that in the future. And whether or not he's the liaison with the Court, those are probably inappropriate choice of words. He was asked by the Court - as you well know - to perform a specific function, uh - and - and - uh - I can understand how he's become involved in it at this point because what he amounts to - is - is -</p><p id = "defense">[464] FORD: Is a liaison.</p><p id = "defense">[465] THE COURT: Well, he's not a liaison with the Court. He's a - I guess what the better word would be is a - a - a second counsel for uh - Mr. Misskelley, by direction of the Court.</p><p id = "defense">[466] FORD: Well Your Honor, if he is a counsel for Misskelley, then we contend that his remarks are prohibited by the ethical on restrictions of remarks to the press because he is making remarks about evidence in a case that could -</p><p id = "defense">[467] THE COURT: Well now, what has he made - what remarks has he made with regard to evidence in the case?</p><p id = "defense">[468] FORD: Just that he's -</p><p id = "defense">[469] THE COURT: He's speculated on whether or not the man will testify is what I understand. And I just announced what he told me and I assume it's the same thing he told them and that's quite a bit different from commenting on testimony. So, is there anything else? Alright, call the jury in. But I will tell him not to make anymore comments to the newspapers or to the uh - press.</p><p id = "defense">[470] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[471] THE COURT: It's a lot brighter in here, isn't it?</p><p id = "defense">[472] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[473] THE COURT: In fact, I'll get one of the bailiffs to tell him not to -</p><p id = "defense">[474] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[475] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, would the Court inquire if there are any witnesses in the courtroom that weren't in here yesterday and if there are - I don't know if there are -</p><p id = "prosecution">[476] THE COURT: Is there anyone in the courtroom that knows themselves to be a witness in this case or anyone that has been subpoenaed by the state or the defendants in the case as a witness?</p><p id = "prosecution">[477] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[478] THE COURT: Ok Bryn, you can come up here and retake the stand.

Would you take the corner and just using state's exhibit 13, if you would describe um - for the jury um - where the um - the items that you found were in relation to the diagram.</p><p id = "prosecution">[488] RIDGE: Ok. McAuley driving west - here is the trail at the end, which is a dead end street. It goes to the pipe across Ten Mile Bayou. Here's the trail that goes to the back of Blue Beacon. Uh - there's a trail that comes off of here that goes across Turtle Hill and across this little uh - gully type area, and this is the area that is uh - the crime scene and the bodies were found at the bottom of this ditch.</p><p id = "prosecution">[489] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, in reference to the pipe uh - that you've indicated - I want to direct your attention to this inset over here, uh - is that a uh - a cross section or detail of the pipe and the high-beams beside the pipe?</p><p id = "prosecution">[490] RIDGE: Yes sir, it is.</p><p id = "prosecution">[491] FOGLEMAN: And does that fairly portray the manner in which uh - the pipe and the high-beams appear?</p><p id = "prosecution">[492] RIDGE: Yes sir, it does.</p><p id = "prosecution">[493] FOGLEMAN: Now, if you could describe uh - what these reference points are on the diagram and where Michael Moore was found in relation to those reference points.</p><p id = "prosecution">[494] RIDGE: Ok. Here, this white area, is where this bank was - had the scuff marks, uh - absence of leaves, uh - the slicked over cleared area. That was above the body of Michael Moore. Michael Moore was found here in the bottom of this creek. Uh - the high bank level is the level of ground out here that's going through this area. That point of the crime scene high bank average was 215 feet above the degree sea level or average sea level. The shelf level was approximately 210 feet above average sea level, and that is 5 feet below the surrounding area. The flow line or - this ditch is actually a ditch within a ditch, in other words, there are - a long sloping bank and then at the bottom of that sloping bank is an area that holds water that the water flows in case there is a very heavy rain and then there will be another bank that goes up on the other side. This smaller area in the center, between these two lines in the center is that lower ditch. And the low bank level is 209 feet to 210 on the average above sea level. Uh - the flow line, the very bottom of that ditch is 207 and 1/2 feet above sea level. The difference being between 215 and 207 is like 7 and 1/2 feet straight down from the top bank all the way to the bottom of the ditch. Ok, uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[495] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now on here is - you've got a point here, a point here, and a point there - what are those points?</p><p id = "prosecution">[496] RIDGE: Ok. On this flat level um - the shelf that had the scuff marks, the slicked off area, there is a tree at the north side of that area and uh - that tree was used as a reference point for measuring where specific items of the bodies were located at the crime scene. Uh - directly across the creek on the upper bank there is another tree and that tree was also used as a reference point. Below the bottom - body of, um - the victim, Michael Moore, uh - close to the creek there is a group of three trees and those trees are reference point also for those measurements and just below those three trees is where the body of Stevie Branch and Christopher Byers were located.</p><p id = "prosecution">[497] FOGLEMAN: Detective Ridge, if you would take this pen and first uh - if you would, draw a stick figure uh - of where Michael Moore was discovered.</p><p id = "prosecution">[498] RIDGE: Michael Moore was discovered in this area right here. Head to the north, he was laying on his left side, the body coming down at an angle, his knees forming a square, then his arms tied to his knees, he was facing east or toward Memphis from this area. The body of Stevie Branch was - the head was downstream. He had the body, the shoulders, the arms toward the feet. He had the torso and then the other two legs and again those were tied in the same manner in which he was found. The body of Christopher Byers was in line after that and then the head downstream toward the south. The arms tied to the feet. Again, downstream in that manner.</p><p id = "prosecution">[499] FOGLEMAN: Alright now - and you may have testified to this, I may have just missed it - uh - you indicated that Michael Moore was on his left side.

The motion of limine in this case would be there was no introduction of occult activity and occult information as to the Court held an in camera hearing to determine that there is a factual basis to establish - that is true.</p><p id = "defense">[1320] PRICE: Which was filed by Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Echols did not join in on that motion, Judge.</p><p id = "defense">[1321] FORD: We object, Your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[1322] PRICE: Dude, but basically the statement says the witness saw two black males and a white male leaving the wooded area and there are times - I think these are from 3 to 6. And then I want to ask the officer about his conclusion -</p><p id = "defense">[1323] THE COURT: Wait a minute. Alright ladies and gentlemen, I'm gonna give you your noon recess at this time and ask that you report back at 12:30 and again you're reminded of the admonition of the Court not to discuss the case and you're free to go until 12:30.</p><p id = "defense">[1324] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[1325] FORD: Your Honor, we would ask that the witness not that the witness be excluded from this conversation 'cause his testimony could be affected by what is said, exchanges by counsel, by the Court.

Let's wait until they get out. </p><p id = "defense">[1329] FORD: Your Honor, can we ask that the witness leave?</p><p id = "defense">[1330] THE COURT: Well, the witness is gonna be needed. We're gonna be asking him questions, I assume. </p><p id = "defense">[1331] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[1332] (metal detector screaming in background)</p><p id = "defense">[1333] THE COURT: Alright, court's in session. I'm just waiting for it to settle down in the courtroom so we can get started here. Alright, let the record reflect that this is a hearing out of the presence of the jury. Alright gentlemen, uh - what exactly is it you want to do, Mr. Price? If you're gonna question the officer from a police report that he made, then I'm gonna sustain the objection to it. Police reports are not exceptions to the hearsay rule. If you wanna call a witness that he identified and have that witness take the stand, question the witness about a statement they may have given an officer - fine. Otherwise, uh - it's hearsay.</p><p id = "defense">[1334] PRICE: Judge, my point is, the officer talked to a witness that indicated that there was one white male and two black males seen coming out of the Robin Hood area between 5:30 and 6:00 pm on the day of the murders. The officer adds his own conclusion (reading) has been mentioned that during occult activity, some members blacken their faces. The statement he took from the witness was on May 8th, which would have been 3 days after the bodies were found and it's our contention that the police - from day one, were alleging that this is a cult relate killing but that there's no evidence of a cult related killing. And that's part of the - and that's part of our theory about attacking the police investigation. That's why the initials questions I asked Officer Allen yesterday about -</p><p id = "defense">[1335] THE COURT: You gonna bring up any cult activity as a possible motive? Do you plan to develop that in this case?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1336] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we haven't made that decision. It depends on how the case develops.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1337] THE COURT: Ok. Well, in any event, Mr. Price if you want to produce that evidence, you can call Kim Williams.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1338] PRICE: Alright, but Kim Williams didn't make the comment that (reading) during - it has been mentioned that occult activity, some members blacken their faces. Detective Ridge -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1339] THE COURT: Is that what you want to ask him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1340] PRICE: Yes sir. That's exactly - because they take a statement -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1341] THE COURT: You want to interject it, yourself?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1342] PRICE: Yes sir. They take a statement -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1343] THE COURT: Well, I'm not gonna allow that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1344] PRICE: Judge, they take a statement from a witness that sees two black men and a white make coming out of the Robin Hood's area and that rather than pursuing whether or not a black male was out there, they turn around and say this must be a cult killing because the conclusion say it here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1345] THE COURT: What you're basically asking the officer to do, rather than testify to what the woman told him - which would be hearsay on his part, is to testify to a conclusion he drew from hearsay testimony?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1346] PRICE: That's exactly right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1347] THE COURT: Or an opinion that he drew off of hear -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1348] PRICE: That's exactly right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1349] THE COURT: No, I'm not gonna allow him to state his opinion or conclusion that he drew from hearsay statement.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1350] PRICE: Alright. Will the Court allow me to put him back on the stand after I call Ms. Williams?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1351] THE COURT: Yeah, I guess so. You can ask him at that point perhaps, uh - well, I'm not even sure then whether his opinion or conclusion would be admissible. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1352] PRICE: Judge, that's our whole point. It's our position that this is not a cult related killing, that there's absolutely no evidence at the crime scene of a cult related killing.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1353] THE COURT: I haven't heard in opening statements or any remarks on the part of the prosecutors that even suggested that will be an attempt on their part to prove motive. In the previous case which you attended most of, I think they were - it was their theory that that was a possible motive for the killing and they may prove motive if they're able to do so and they may not prove motive, they don't have to, so if they are electing not to in this case - it's a different trial stradegy.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1354] PRICE: Well, I noticed that one of the witness subpoena by the state is a cult expert from Ohio and I suppose -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1355] THE COURT: Does that mean that they're gonna call him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1356] PRICE: Well, that means that we are certainly preparing if they call him, Judge.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1357] THE COURT: Well -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1358] PRICE: Is the state saying that they are not going to claim that this is a cult related killing?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1359] THE COURT: I don't know, they're not required to say that. I don't know, but I'm not gonna let you ask this police officer to repeat hearsay one and two and -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1360] PRICE: I'm not asking for the hearsay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1361] THE COURT: I'm not gonna let him give his opinion or conclusion on the basis of that hearsay. I mean, we can spend days here if you went through every person they interviewed and ask 'em what Joe Bleaux told you on the 5th day of June, 1993 - I mean, that's hearsay. </p><p id = "defense">[1362] DAVIDSON: He's not asking that, Your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[1363] PRICE: I'm asking -</p><p id = "defense">[1364] THE COURT: He's asking - he's asking the officer basically did you take a statement from so and so, and based upon that statement - which is clearly hearsay and you know it -</p><p id = "defense">[1365] PRICE: Yes sir, that's correct.</p><p id = "defense">[1366] THE COURT: To formulate an opinion or draw a conclusion, and I'm not going to allow that. </p><p id = "defense">[1367] PRICE: Our position, Judge, within two or three days after the murders, the police - the West Memphis Police Department was alleging that this was a cult related killing, that's the only reason they went after my client, Damien Echols. To try to link him in a cult related killing.</p><p id = "defense">[1368] THE COURT: Again, whether or not it was -</p><p id = "defense">[1369] PRICE: And that's why we're entitled to bring it up to this witness.</p><p id = "defense">[1370] THE COURT: Whether or not it was cult related doesn't really have a whole lot to do with anything here, unless that was a possible motive. Do you want to prove motive?</p><p id = "defense">[1371] PRICE: I want to disprove motive, Judge. I want to disprove motive.</p><p id = "defense">[1372] THE COURT: Well, motive - they don't have to prove motive.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1373] FOGLEMAN: Well Your Honor, if they want to stipulate Mr. Echols -</p><p id = "defense">[1374] FORD: Wait, wait. If you're gonna say "they", we need to let the record reflect who "they" is.</p><p id = "defense">[1375] FOGLEMAN: If Mr. Price and Mr. Davidson want to stipulate that Damien Echols was involved in satanism and devil worship, uh - then we don't have any objection with him going into that.</p><p id = "defense">[1376] PRICE: We're not stipulating that, Judge. We're not stipulating that, that's the whole purpose for the case. But because the sate - because the police was pushing this as a cult related killing -</p><p id = "defense">[1377] THE COURT: Alright. I'll do this, I'm gonna - same ruling I've made, if the state attempts to prove cult related activity - and the only way I would even allow them to do that is if they suggested that was a possible motive for the homicides. If they do that, then that's gonna open the door for you to attack the officers upon, uh - that basis. </p><p id = "defense">[1378] FORD: Your Honor, I would like to state on behalf of Mr. Baldwin that the order is, not only that they attempt to offer it but you - they have to determine in camera that there is a reasonable basis for that conclusion to even be brought out.</p><p id = "defense">[1379] THE COURT: That's why we're having this hearing right now partially. On the other hand, if it were introduced going to Mr. Echols only and that the only effort or attempt was to establish evidence on the part of Mr. Echols' activity in that regard then there will be very strong cautionary instruction given to the jury that that evidence should be taken to Echols only and not to Mr. Baldwin. </p><p id = "defense">[1380] PRICE: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[1381] THE COURT: And at this time, I'm not gonna allow it - period.</p><p id = "defense">[1382] PRICE: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[1383] THE COURT: It's hearsay, it's conclusionary, supposition, and opinion on the part of the officer based upon the unsubstantiated hearsay statement for which the people observed by which the - declarant haven't even been identified. I'm not even sure it's relevant. Although it could be. </p><p id = "defense">[1384] PRICE: If the state alleges a cult related killing, it's certainly relevant.</p><p id = "defense">[1385] THE COURT: Well -</p><p id = "defense">[1386] PRICE: Ofcourse they haven't made that -</p><p id = "defense">[1387] THE COURT: They haven't done that. Until they open that up, then I'm gonna say that you don't have any right to cross examine witnesses on cult activity. Now, if they open it up in effort to prove some motive, then it's "Katie bar the door", you can go right ahead.</p><p id = "defense">[1388] PRICE: Alright.</p><p id = "defense">[1389] THE COURT: Ok?</p><p id = "defense">[1390] DAVIDSON: At that time, Your Honor - just to make it clear, we would have to recall these witnesses.</p><p id = "defense">[1391] THE COURT: That's fine.</p><p id = "defense">[1392] DAVIDSON: Just wanted to make that be known.</p><p id = "defense">[1393] THE COURT: That's fine, but now I want each of ya to understand - if you want to make any record on it now, if you're going to attempt to call the hundreds of people, uh - if you're going to attempt to cross examine police officers on the basis of interviews taken in this case that lead to blind leaves, false alleys, uh - whatever term you choose to use, uh - that's going to be a hearsay, um - issue because a police report is hearsay. Now if you want to call all those people, I might allow it but even then the question of relevancy is gonna crop up so let's get that out of the way right now so we don't have to waste anymore time on those issues. </p><p id = "defense">[1394] FORD: Well Your Honor, until the trial develops -</p><p id = "defense">[1395] THE COURT: I mean - </p><p id = "defense">[1396] FORD: Until the state's offered it's case, the method and manner in which the witness will be cross examined - it's impossible to make a record as to how we may cross examine Mr. Gitchell, how we may cross examine Mr. Durham - until they testify.</p><p id = "defense">[1397] THE COURT: I'm not telling ya that, Mr. Ford. </p><p id = "defense">[1398] FORD: You're saying if we are gonna question these witnesses about something they may have learned or may have - what their investigation revealed - he's testifying now what his investigation revealed -</p><p id = "defense">[1399] THE COURT: He can testify to what's in his personal knowledge. He can not testify what someone told him. Officers go out and conduct interviews and take statements from people, those statements and interviews are hearsay. And that's what I'm telling you. Ok. And it doesn't take, uh -</p><p id = "defense">[1400] FORD: It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.</p><p id = "defense">[1401] THE COURT: Alright. That's what I'm telling ya. </p><p id = "defense">[1402] DAVIDSON: But at the same time, we can ask him why he didn't follow that lead, can we not? </p><p id = "defense">[1403] (mumbling)</p><p id = "defense">[1404] THE COURT: Well, if you get the lead in by credible evidence, perhaps you can ask why he didn't follow it but I suggest that if in order to develop the lead is hearsay, then no you can't ask him that. So if you're gonna try and introduce hearsay, you better get me some real strong law - and I think rule 803 subparagraph A is rather clear and all the andoctated cases on, it's extremely clear that it's blatant hearsay.</p><p id = "defense">[1405] PRICE: If the state is not gonna allege it's a cult related killing, that's fine Judge.</p><p id = "defense">[1406] THE COURT: Well, I don't know whether they are or not, until they do then you are not gonna open that area yourself.</p><p id = "defense">[1407] PRICE: But if they do, Judge -</p><p id = "defense">[1408] THE COURT: If they do, then I think -</p><p id = "defense">[1409] PRICE: There will be alot more coming in.</p><p id = "defense">[1410] FORD: Your Honor, we -</p><p id = "defense">[1411] THE COURT: Well let me put it like this, if they attempt to prove motive and that attempt uh - develops cult or satanic business and you want to ask the officer "Did you come to the conclusion or form an opinion that it was satanic", then perhaps I'll allow it at that time. But even then, the statement given by the witness is still hearsay, so you're not gonna get that witness' statement in by the officer conducting the interview.</p><p id = "defense">[1412] PRICE: But once I put that statement - once I put that witness on, then I could call Officer Ridge back on the stand about each conclusion he had?</p><p id = "defense">[1413] THE COURT: Well, I'm not sure his conclusions or opinions are admissible at all and they're certainly not relevant, unless the state has attempted to prove motive. If they have, then maybe I would find that they were relevant.</p><p id = "defense">[1414] PRICE: Is the Court aware of, we have a thousand pages of discovery from the state alleging a cult related killing?</p><p id = "defense">[1415] THE COURT: I've read most of it.</p><p id = "defense">[1416] PRICE: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[1417] THE COURT: Doesn't mean they have to prove motive. If they don't open it up then -</p><p id = "defense">[1418] FORD: Is the Court stating that it has read the prosecution's discovery file?</p><p id = "defense">[1419] THE COURT: No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying I've read many of the documents that you've put before me and some of those depositions were read by the Court previously.</p><p id = "defense">[1420] FORD: Ok. </p><p id = "defense">[1421] THE COURT: I haven't seen the state's file or your file for that matter. </p><p id = "defense">[1422] FORD: Well now, you just indicated that you had read it and I just wondered where you had read it -</p><p id = "defense">[1423] THE COURT: No, that's not what I said, I said I had read much of it or many of 'em. And I assume that your discoveries are all a matter of this court record anyway, which I have read.</p><p id = "defense">[1424] PRICE: It's a matter of 15 black volumes over here, but -</p><p id = "defense">[1425] THE COURT: I haven't read all that junk and don't intend to.</p><p id = "defense">[1426] PRICE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1427] THE COURT: I just want to be sure you understand what I'm saying, what's hearsay, 'cause the police statements are hearsay and I'm not gonna allow ya to call an officer up here and did you take a statement from Joe Bleaux or did he or she say such and such.</p><p id = "defense">[1428] PRICE: But it's his conclusion, is what I was attempting to -</p><p id = "defense">[1429] THE COURT: Well, I mean that - conclusions and opinions are not admissible under our modern rules and under our modern uh - procedures of evidence, uh - some opinions and some conclusions by laypersons are appropriate and are admissible if they're the type opinions and conclusions that are normally drawn by laypeople.</p><p id = "defense">[1430] PRICE: But Judge, the whole focus of the investigation of the police was focusing, alleging that my client was a satanist and all the people that they asked - many of it was centered on whether or not my client believes in satan -</p><p id = "defense">[1431] THE COURT: Well, they very well may believed during the course of investigation that that was the reason for the killings. </p><p id = "defense">[1432] (pause)</p><p id = "defense">[1433] THE COURT: And motive is something they can, if they choose to prove and can--they can, if they don't choose to prove it--they don't have to. So until there is an effort to prove motive in that area, then I'm not gonna allow you to open up something that's not relevant. Particularly through opinion testimony, you might be able to do it some other way. But you're not going to do it through opinion of an Officer based upon a hearsay statement. That's what I'm saying at this point, and I'm not barring you from developing that as a - your theory of the case, you certainly can do it if you can do it through other credible evidence.</p><p id = "defense">[1434] FORD: Your Honor, we're excused til 12:30?</p><p id = "defense">[1435] THE COURT: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[1436] FORD: Thank you sir.</p><p id = "defense">[1437] THE COURT: Court will be in recess until 12:30.</p><p id = "defense">[1438] (audio stops, then begins abruptly)</p><p id = "defense">[1439] (Open Court)</p><p id = "defense">[1440] PRICE: --state's exhibit number 48, when was state's exhibit number 45, and when was state's exhibit number 52?

It's uh--I believe that he's asking questions that are not within the Officer's knowledge. I think the Officer testified that he removed the clothes from the water, put 'em in the sack, and I don't remember any testimony about him--ya know, microscopically or any other way inspecting the pants or these things.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1500] PRICE: Officer Ridge, did you look at the pants when you pulled them out of the water?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1501] RIDGE: Yes sir, I looked at 'em.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1502] PRICE: Were you looking for any evidence when you looked at the pants?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1503] RIDGE: Anything obvious, yes sir. But my main purpose was to preserve any fibers, trace, anything that may be on that clothing and put it in that sack.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1504] PRICE: Ok. Once they were placed in the sack, and you testified earlier about the procedure of drying out and then going to the crime lab.

The next pair of pants would be, also a pair of blue pants, state's exhibit number 45. There appears there on the front part--there appears to be a cut out portion with some numbers by it. Alright.

If you would refresh your recollection by looking at any report that you prepared at the crime scene, would you be able to tell?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1509] RIDGE: Uh--no sir. Only that I remember two of the pants were inside out and one pair was right side out.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1510] PRICE: Alright. Did you notice any type of tears on these pants as you pulled them out of the water?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1511] RIDGE: I didn't notice any, no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1512] PRICE: Ok. Did you notice any blood on these pants when you pulled them out of the water?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1513] RIDGE: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1514] PRICE: Ok. (mumbling) My last question would deal with state's exhibit number 52, these are blue jean pants. Um--there's a couple of--looks like a marking with some additional markings on the back portion, which I assume would be something the crime lab may have done. And there's some areas on the front, but other than that--excuse me, also the left knee, there appears to be a torn out area. Any type of um--of either tears above the waist or tears by the bottom part of the cuffs of the pants, that you recall?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1515] RIDGE: Not that I'm aware, no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1516] PRICE: How about any evidence of any type of blood on the pants that you can recall?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1517] RIDGE: Nothing visible, no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1518] PRICE: Ok. And to your knowledge, were the buttons on each of those three pairs of pants--was the buttons themselves actually working?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1519] RIDGE: I'm not certain. Uh--</p><p id = "prosecution">[1520] PRICE: What--</p><p id = "prosecution">[1521] RIDGE: They were placed in the sack exactly as I removed them from the water and that's the best that I can recall. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1522] PRICE: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1523] RIDGE: I didn't work any of the buttons, I didn't work any of the zippers.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1524] PRICE: Alright.

I don't know why we're putting in Detective Ridge's footprint.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1538] PRICE: Judge, the reason is, I want to rule out this footprint as oppose to the additional unknown prints that were found at the crime scene. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1539] FOGLEMAN: That's fine, Your Honor. We don't have any objections to that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1540] PRICE: Detective Ridge, this uh--E-2 or Echols 2, that was a particular footprint that you had left at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[1541] RIDGE: Yes, it is my footprint.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1542] PRICE: Alright.

And also, if I could approach. Take a look at that, um--is the picture you're looking at now, is that the same picture as the other one? Is that the same--strike that question. Does both of the pictures show the same cast?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1553] RIDGE: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1554] PRICE: Alright. Was there more than one cast taken at the crime scene?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1555] RIDGE: At the crime scene?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1556] PRICE: At the crime scene.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1557] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1558] PRICE: Alright.

Judge, I think it might be easier, since I don't want to duplicate the photographs, but if I could approach the witness and let him look at these and --</p><p id = "prosecution">[1593] RIDGE: Do you want to keep 'em in order?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1594] PRICE: Naa, go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1595] RIDGE: Ok. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1596] PRICE: I think once he has a chance to look at 'em, I can mark 'em and proceed with questioning.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1597] THE COURT: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1598] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[1599] RIDGE: Ok sir, I can give you some explanations for these pictures if that's what you'd like.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1600] PRICE: Ok.

Is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1834] RIDGE: Yes sir, that's correct. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1835] WADLEY: Let me ask you a different way. How many hours do you think you looked out there - looked in the manner you told the jury, how many hours do you think you spent out there looking?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1836] RIDGE: Uh - myself personally, probably 20 to 25 hours. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1837] WADLEY: And then there were other officers out there looking the same - with you, the same time - for the same amount of time, is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1838] RIDGE: That's correct.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1839] WADLEY: Ok.

Yes sir, there were some other officers out there taking possession of items. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1843] WADLEY: On those days we're talking about?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1844] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1845] WADLEY: 6th, 7th, 8th. </p><p id = "prosecution">[1846] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1847] WADLEY: Who were those officers?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1848] RIDGE: Uh - Officer Charlie Dabbs, Officer Lt.

But they may have taken items at the scene -</p><p id = "prosecution">[1853] WADLEY: That you were unaware of?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1854] RIDGE: - and then they gave it to me.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1855] WADLEY: Ok. They - you're the one that was responsible for being in charge of gathering these items, is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1856] RIDGE: That's correct.</p><p id = "prosecution">[1857] WADLEY: Ok. So if someone found something, they were to bring it to you - is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1858] RIDGE: That's correct, yes sir.

This Court has entered an order in limine based upon a hearing -- I believe the 16th of February in Osceola, Arkansas -- that the State is prohibited through its attorneys, through its witnesses, to making any reference to cult activity or cult involvement as any type of involvement or motive in this homicide until such time that they can establish in in camera proceeding that such evidence has any causation -- that there is -- I can't lay my hands on the order but if the Court -- it's in the file -- </p><p id = "defense">[2583] THE COURT: Yeah I'm familiar with what you're talking about. Basically what the Court's -- </p><p id = "defense">[2584] FORD: Your Honor -- </p><p id = "defense">[2585] THE COURT: Go ahead. </p><p id = "defense">[2586] FORD: It's our position that what they are doing right this moment with making references to pentagrams, and -- I'm not sure of the name of that Egyptian type tattoo -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2587] FOGLEMAN: Ankh. </p><p id = "defense">[2588] FORD: -- About his Wiccan religion, and the powers of three, and the symbolism of the power of the penis, that all those things -- that's what they're doing. And if they're gonna proceed with that they should either be pro stopped until they have met the burden that this Court ordered them to meet. </p><p id = "defense">[2589] THE COURT: Alright, the way I remember my ruling -- in fact we talked about it here at the beginning of the trial -- was that if the State chose to use that to prove motive or possibly to attempt to prove motive that they'd be allowed to do so but until they made that election to attempt to prove it as a motive or possible motive for the crime that we would have a Denno hearing, so I assume that's what we're doing now. </p><p id = "defense">[2590] FORD: Your Honor, what the Court's order states -- the Court's order states that "The Court hereby grants the Defendant's motion in limine with respect to the issue of cult involvement until said time as the Court is convinced in an in camera proceeding that there is competent evidence to establish that the Defendant was involved in an occult or occultic type activities and/or that this crime is indicative of a ritualistic occult killing. That until said evidence has been presented to the Court, the State of Arkansas, its counsel, and witnesses shall make no reference to the Defendant's involvement in an occult and/or occultic type activities or the fact that this is an occult killing. That in the event the State of Arkansas desires to elicit said testimony at trial, an in camera proceeding shall be held in order to determine that a proper foundation can be laid by the State of Arkansas." That's what they're attempting to do right now. </p><p id = "defense">[2591] THE COURT: Alright, let's hear what -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2592] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, what the order says -- </p><p id = "defense">[2593] FORD: I just read it. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2594] FOGLEMAN: I know, but maybe you don't understand it. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2595] (Fogleman and Ford talking over each other - unintelligible) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2596] FOGLEMAN: The order says -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2597] THE COURT: Okay, one at the time. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2598] FOGLEMAN: The order says, that we won't get into that until "there is competent evidence to establish that the Defendant was involved in an occult or occultic type activities," and slash or, or, "that the crime was indicative of a ritualistic occult killing." The way Mr. Ford drafted the order we either show he's involved in it or it's a ritualistic occult killing, and if it's out of the defendant's own mouth about things related to the occult then -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2599] WADLEY: For starters, your Honor, it's supposed to be done in camera before there's any reference to it and it wasn't done. They go straight to it, your Honor. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2600] FOGLEMAN: But -- it's not -- in this order it says that we will have that hearing unless there's competent evidence. We're not talking about something -- we've avoided totally another witness referring to the occult. We have totally avoided that. Mr. Price asked some questions related to it, but we have totally avoided it until we got to the defendant's own words. </p><p id = "defense">[2601] FORD: But your Honor, the point is -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2602] FOGLEMAN: And they establish by competent evidence that he's involved in occultic type activities. </p><p id = "defense">[2603] FORD: Your Honor, what evidence has there been to link this young man to it? And that's the purpose of my order. This is a separate trial and this Court has said, You can't do that to this defendant until there is some evidence to link him, and that hasn't been done and that's why we feel our order in limine has been violated and that this Court should prohibit further questioning from this witness or any other witness regardless of who made the statements. </p><p id = "defense">[2604] THE COURT: Can either one of you define "occult" for me? </p><p id = "defense">[2605] FORD: Well we can get Webster's dictionary, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[2606] THE COURT: I don't know what an occult is.

I suppose he can explain it to us. </p><p id = "defense">[2611] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, the fact is, as Mr. Ford's doing all this, the Court's already given the jury an instruction that this evidence -- or evidence is to be taken separately as to each defendant. We're talking about the words out of the defendant's own mouth, Damien Echols. </p><p id = "defense">[2612] FORD: Your Honor, if the Court is going to allow them to violate the reference, to violate the motion in limine –- it says you can't make a reference -- that wasn't -- you signed it, it's this Court's order. </p><p id = "defense">[2613] THE COURT: Alright, I don't feel that any references been made to the, quote, the occult. They've asked him about tattoos, markings on his body, that's just physically there. </p><p id = "defense">[2614] FORD: Pentagram? Pentagram? It's not a related -- </p><p id = "defense">[2615] THE COURT: If he's got a pentagram on his chest it's there. </p><p id = "defense">[2616] FORD: I understand that, your Honor, but that is a -- </p><p id = "defense">[2617] THE COURT: It could have been a sign that said "Mother" with a heart on it, it's still there. </p><p id = "defense">[2618] FORD: But the Court did not order in limine the State of Arkansas make no reference to the tattoos -- </p><p id = "defense">[2619] THE COURT: I'm – I'm finding that they haven't violated the rule by asking the witness to describe what physical features were on the defendant Echols' body. Nor have they violated the rule to ask the witness to describe what the defendant Echols said to them. </p><p id = "defense">[2620] PRICE: About his belief in the Wiccan religion? That get's into occultism, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[2621] FORD: That's the entire reason we had the order -- </p><p id = "defense">[2622] THE COURT: I understand that there's some subtle difference between the wiccans and the occults, but now what it is I couldn't tell you. But from what I read in the newspaper that one disavows the other whatever that means. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2623] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, the question wasn't related -- the question was, Did he tell you about why someone do it, and did you ask him a question like that and who did you think (?) and what was his response. </p><p id = "defense">[2624] FORD: But your Honor, the taint is to Jason. And to Jason there's no link. </p><p id = "defense">[2625] THE COURT: Well I'll give a cautionary instruction on that as far as -- are you gonna take this any further, I mean are you gonna go into the -- </p><p id = "defense">[2626] FORD: If they -- </p><p id = "defense">[2627] THE COURT: Wait just a minute, we're having an in camera hearing now for those purposes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2628] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, there is some more that's related to that type of thing, if for right now you want me to restrict it to him telling about how he thinks they died and -- uhm -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2629] THE COURT: Are you going -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2630] PRICE: Judge, is the State now stating that the motive is occult killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2631] THE COURT: That's what I'm trying to ask. Do you plan at any time, now or in the future, in this trial to introduce evidence of occult activity as a possibly motive for the killings? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2632] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, I believe -- we haven't made a final, firm decision but at this point I would say yes. </p><p id = "defense">[2633] DAVIDSON: Your Honor, we would request some knowledge of whether they are or they aren't, or if nothing else judicial economy. You have prevented us from bringing this testimony in. We wanted this testimony in from the beginning to be able to question detective Ridge and everybody else about that. We've been unable to question anybody about this so far, and what it's going to entail is bringing every one of these witnesses back. </p><p id = "defense">[2634] THE COURT: I guess that's what we'll have to do if they propose to use it as a form of motive. Do you anticipate any proof in the case to directly or indirectly link the defendant Jason Baldwin to occult activities?</p><p id = "prosecution">[2635] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, that's something that will have to be talked with -- about the expert. It's my understanding that part of the involvement of somebody deals with obsession with heavy metal music, change in forms of dress, wearing all black and that kind of thing. And, your Honor, I believe the proof would show that he had, I wanna say fifteen black t-shirts with the heavy metal thing, had some kind of an animal, either claws or teeth -- I think they said they were claws -- in his possession. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2636] WADLEY: Judge, that -- first of all, they don't even know what that is. But secondly judge, that's a part -- that's something that the Court has ruled -- in my understanding -- is that that was something, it was not something that was a part of the search warrant and the Court was gonna suppress that. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2637] FOGLEMAN: The black t-shirts? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2638] WADLEY: No -- this thing, you don't know what it is. You're talking about that -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2639] FOGLEMAN: Oh the teeth or claws or whatever it is. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2640] WADLEY: Judge, if it's the State's position that owning black t-shirts with rock bands on them it meets the Court's burden to go above this motion in limine -- is that what you're telling us -- that fact alone is enough? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2641] FOGLEMAN: You also have, your Honor, the testimony that Michael Carson gave related to the sucking of the blood from the penis, and I think the evidence would show that drinking of blood is something that these people believe gives them power. </p><p id = "defense">[2642] FORD: Your Honor, I think it's time that – if they're gonna proceed, that we have this in camera hearing -- </p><p id = "defense">[2643] THE COURT: We're having it right now. </p><p id = "defense">[2644] FORD: Well they need to call their witnesses if we're gonna make those -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[2645] FOGLEMAN: He's not here today, your Honor. </p><p id = "defense">[2646] FORD: Then we can't have the in camera proceeding, your Honor, if we can't question the expert. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2647] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, our point on detective Ridge was that these are statements that the defendant Damien Echols made himself. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2648] THE COURT: I'm gonna allow his statements. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2649] FOGLEMAN: The Court has already given a cautionary instruction that it's to its affect -- or to consider it as to one or the other. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2650] THE COURT: I'm gonna allow his statements, but if you plan on calling an expert in the occult, whatever it is, then we'll have to conduct an in camera hearing. </p><p id = "defense">[2651] Mr .Davidson: So your Honor, if you're ruling they can bring in anything except their expert -- </p><p id = "defense">[2652] THE COURT: No that's not what I ruled. I ruled that statements made by your client to this witness are admissible. </p><p id = "defense">[2653] DAVIDSON: What about -- so I know -- what about other witnesses, will we be able to question them on this or will we still be prevented like we have been, from questioning them regarding -- </p><p id = "defense">[2654] THE COURT: Based upon their statement that they intend to prove as a possible motivation for the crime occult activities, then I think you can ask witnesses any question you want in that area. But I'm also ruling before I allow any expert witness to testify I wanna hear what he's got to say and we're gonna have another Denno hearing or in camera hearing. You know, motive is something you may be able to prove, you may not be able to prove, you may just come partway on. </p><p id = "defense">[2655] PRICE: But we'd like to challenge that motive if they're trying to introduce -- </p><p id = "defense">[2656] THE COURT: Sure. And I'm gonna allow you to challenge it. </p><p id = "defense">[2657] FORD: Based on the fact that this Court has entered an order prohibiting this type of evidence from being received in the trial against Jason Baldwin, and it's now being received by virtue of the fact that there's a statement made by a co-defendant, we renew our motion for a -- </p><p id = "defense">[2658] THE COURT: No. </p><p id = "defense">[2659] FORD: -- severance. </p><p id = "defense">[2660] THE COURT: Alright that will be denied.

Did he say anything about the fact that the children were young? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2696] A: Yes sir, he said that the younger the children the more innocent they would be, and in turn the more innocent that person would be the more power that would be derived by that killing. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2697] Q: What did he say about doing evil, about how that returns? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2698] A: Doing evil would be returned three times.

Was this a set of questions that was asked to a number of suspects or witnesses in this particular case? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2760] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2761] Q: Alright. Do you recall approximately the date that y'all first prepared this particular questionnaire? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2762] A: I didn't prepare the questionnaire. My recollection is that lieutenant Sudbury prepared it. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2763] Q: Alright, do you recall approximately what date it was that this questionnaire was initially written out? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2764] A: Prior to the 10th. I'm not exactly sure when. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2765] Q: Alright. Do you know if there were other individuals that you asked the same thirty-two questions to before you questioned Mr. Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2766] A: Okay sir, you're referring to me using this sheet. Most of the time I did not use this sheet. Lieutenant Sudbury would use this sheet as the interview continued. He would look at those questions and if a response applied to a question that's where he would check it off. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2767] Q: Alright, I notice there's a typed up version that has numbers, one, that appeared, well -- it's not -- let me show you. Take a look at that (inaudible?) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2768] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2769] Q: Alright. That appears to be -- that appears to have all thirty-two questions listed, it looks like there's a lot of them with some of them kind of skip around. So, is it your testimony that during the questioning of Mr. Echols, if y'all would cover a certain question and he'd give an answer related to that question, y'all would write something down about it? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2770] A: Lieutenant Sudbury would. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2771] Q: But it's not something that y'all went directly down all thirty-two questions in chronological order? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2772] A: No sir, I did not. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2773] Q: Alright. I notice one of the questions here -- number nine, says "How do you think they died?" Was that a question that you asked almost everybody that y'all had interviewed? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2774] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2775] Q: Okay. Alright, now, I noticed -- during the approximate two-hour interrogation of Mr. Echols, did you ever tape record your conversation? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2776] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2777] Q: And did you ever videotape your conversation? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2778] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2779] Q: Did you ever go back and after you had your written notes, has Mr. Echols to look at them and read them over and sign at the bottom agreeing that this is what he said? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2780] A: No sir, I did not. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2781] Q: I believe you have -- there was a -- the longhand sheet that looks like legal aid paper, about four pages, this was -- were these the notes you were writing as you went along? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2782] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2783] Q: Alright. And then later you went back, and I believe you had written out on a investigative report form, the one with the lines on it, approximately three pages, sort of condensing his responses. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2784] A: An outline form, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2785] Q: An outline form, okay. And then you went back later and actually had it typed up, a typed up version? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2786] A: I typed it, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2787] Q: Okay. But basically, all three of these relate to essentially the same two hour period of time that you interrogated Mr. Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2788] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2789] Q: Alright. At the time that you were questioning Mr. Echols on May the 10th, did you think that this was a cult related killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2790] A: I thought it was a possibility, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2791] Q: Did you also think that this was a sex killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2792] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2793] Q: Okay. I notice -- another question listed on here, number 10, "Do you believe in God dash the devil." That was a question that you asked Mr. Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2794] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2795] Q: Alright. Was that also a question that you asked all the individuals that you interviewed using this particular questionnaire? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2796] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2797] Q: Now there were other -- there were some people that you talked to, if you're asking for a particular thing, you didn't go down the full set of questions? Right? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2798] A: I never used the questions per se. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2799] Q: Okay. Alright. I notice another question on here, number 27, "Do you believe in white or black magic." Was that a topic that you covered with -- was that a subject that you covered with Mr. Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2800] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2801] Q: Alright, you had mentioned a few minutes ago that, in your opinion that Mr. Echols, when you were questioning him on May the 10th, was a possible suspect? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2802] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2803] Q: Alright. Do you have your type written report, the first paragraph? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2804] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2805] Q: Approximately 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, about 8 lines down in the middle of the page where -- middle of the paragraph where it says, "At this point." </p><p id = "prosecution">[2806] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2807] Q: Okay. Please complete that sentence. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2808] A: "At this point Damien was not considered to be a suspect and only general knowledge questions were being asked." </p><p id = "prosecution">[2809] Q: Alright. So, is that your testimony that when you were talking to Damien Echols on May the 10th, he was not a suspect? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2810] A: No sir, I told you he was a suspect. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2811] Q: Okay, but the report indicates that Damien was not considered to be a suspect. Is this in error? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2812] A: May I explain? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2813] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2814] A: Okay. In talking with him, the knowledge he had, the responses he gave to the questions, my belief was he turned that tide to be a suspect. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2815] Q: Alright. So after you questioned Damien Echols on May the 10th, then he became a suspect? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2816] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2817] Q: And, at that time when you completed the interview and he was questioned by some other officers, eventually later on, I believe, late that afternoon, early evening, after the entire interrogation completed, Mr. Echols was allowed to go home? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2818] A: That's correct. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2819] Q: After that, did you all begin to do the surveillance on Damien Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2820] A: Surveillance? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2821] Q: Surveillance. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2822] A: I didn't do any surveillance on Damien Echols. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2823] Q: Okay, did the West Memphis Police Department do surveillance on Damien Echols any time after May the 5th, excuse me, May the 10th, 1992? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2824] A: There was one day in which I think there was some surveillance done in order to see if Damien Echols showed up at a place. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2825] Q: Okay. Was that at the skating rink? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2826] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2827] Q: Okay. To your knowledge, at the skating rink, would that have been on May the 28th? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2828] A: I'm not certain of the date but that's pretty close I guess. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2829] Q: Okay. You're saying the West Memphis Police Department did surveillance at the skating rink on May the 28th to see if Mr. Echols showed up on that occasion? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2830] A: I did, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2831] Q: Okay. And to you knowledge, on that particular occasion, did he show up? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2832] A: Not to my knowledge, no sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2833] Q: Alright. Did you also ask a question of Mr. Echols -- I notice one of the form here, "Do you believe in white or black magic?" </p><p id = "prosecution">[2834] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2835] Q: I believe that's question number 27. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2836] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2837] Q: And that's also a question you asked Mr. Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2838] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2839] Q: Okay. You also asked him number 28, "Do you have or own a Bible?" </p><p id = "prosecution">[2840] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2841] Q: And that was also a question that you asked him? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2842] A: Yes sir, I think so. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2843] Q: During the entire two-hour interrogation that you had with Mr. Echols, he denied involvement in these murders, is that correct? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2844] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2845] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2846] Q: And the -- when you asked other individuals, I mean was there -- approximately two hundred other people that y'all questioned using the same thirty-two page questionnaire form? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2847] A: There were many more, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2848] Q: Okay. Was there an article published in a West Memphis newspaper about what -- speculating on what the manner and the details of the deaths were? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2849] A: Not to my knowledge, I'm not sure. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2850] Q: Okay. Were there rumors running rampant in West Memphis during this time in May about what happened out at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2851] A: There were all kind of rumors, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2852] Q: And did some of these rumors include some of the same things that Mr. Echols told you about during the interrogation? Specifically as to the question number 9 about, "How do you think they died"? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2853] A: Well there were all kinds of rumors of how people thought they died, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2854] Q: Okay. I notice on the notes on page number 2, this is on the long hand written about during the middle, "probably died of mutilation." Mr. Echols was not the only person that told you that the children, the kids, probably died of mutilation, was he? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2855] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2856] Q: Okay. And he indicated that he heard that they were in the water? That was also on here? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2857] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2858] Q: He stated that there would probably be stones in the area? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2859] A: He said that would be something to look for. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2860] Q: Okay. Now, when you looked at the crime scene during the two or three times you were out there, you never found any stones at the crime scene, did you? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2861] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2862] Q: Okay. He also said there might be candles at the crime scene. Did you ever see any candles at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2863] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2864] Q: He also said there would be knives at the crime scene. Did you see any knives at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2865] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2866] Q: He also said there would be crystals at the crime scene. Did you see any crystals at the crime scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2867] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2868] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2869] Q: When you're conducting interviews, do you -- is it -- do you get a much more accurate listing of what questions you asked and what questions they -- or what answers a suspect gives if it's tape recorded? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2870] A: A better record? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2871] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2872] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2873] Q: And on May the 10th the West Memphis Police Department did have a tape recorder? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2874] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2875] Q: Okay. And during this -- during the investigation there were lots of times when the West Memphis Police Department would tape record interviews of various individuals, correct? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2876] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2877] Q: Alright. Did the West Memphis Police Department have a photograph of Damien Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2878] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2879] Q: Okay. Was this one that they obtained within a day or two of the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2880] A: To my understanding, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2881] Q: Okay. Was this based on -- I believe officer Steve Jones and lieutenant Sudbury went out to Damien Echols' house and took a photograph of him? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2882] A: That's my understanding, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2883] Q: The purpose of this photograph was for y'all to be able to have his photograph included amongst a group of photographs so that when you're showing a photographic lineup to possible witnesses, his photograph would be one of the ones included? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2884] A: That's one of several reasons, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2885] Q: And during this investigation, did you conduct several photographic lineups with certain witnesses? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2886] A: I wouldn't say several but there were some done. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2887] Q: Some done, alright. And is it your procedure when doing a photographic lineup to write down who all the photographs are that are shown to a particular witness? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2888] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2889] Q: That's not your procedure? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2890] A: That's not my procedure, no sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2891] Q: Okay. I mean -- do you have a much better idea of knowing what photographs you show a witness if you write down what photographs you show them? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2892] A: That -- yes sir, it could be. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2893] Q: Is it the policy of the West Memphis Police Department when doing a photographic lineup not to show -- or not to write down what photographs are shown to a witness? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2894] A: Is a policy? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2895] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2896] A: There's no policy of that nature. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2897] Q: Alright. Is there a general procedure? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2898] A: I've never done that -- write down a list of the names on photographs shown to a witness? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2899] Q: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2900] A: No sir, I haven't done that unless an identification is made. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2901] Q: Alright. So if an identification -- if photographs are shown to a witness and they did not identify a photograph, you do not write down the ten or however many photographs that witness is shown? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2902] A: No sir, I do not. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2903] Q: Okay. Would you think that -- if you conduct a -- is one reason that you show a photographic lineup to a witness so they can identify a particular person? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2904] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2905] Q: Alright. Is it just as important if you show them a photographic lineup and they don't identify anybody to have that information written down? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2906] A: It's arguably it could be of importance, yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2907] Q: Okay. Do you recall how many times that you conducted photographic lineups with Damien Echols' picture included in a photo line-up to witnesses? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2908] A: I know of on one occasion that I used his picture. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2909] Q: Okay. On that occasion, did the witness identify Damien Echols? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2910] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2911] Q: Okay.

And do you recall that in your report of that conversation you included a statement, "It has been mentioned that during cult activity some members blacken their faces"? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2930] A: Okay sir, you're referring to that to being my report. That is not my report, that's inspector Gitchell's report. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2931] Q: This is inspector Gitchell's report? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2932] A: Yes sir, my report would be the written portion behind that, I think. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2933] Q: Alright.

And so once that information was typed up, the additional comments, the statement I just read, that would have been something that inspector Gitchell would have added? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2938] A: I suspect he's the one who put it in there, it wasn't me. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2939] Q: It was not you? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2940] A: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2941] (Pause) </p><p id = "prosecution">[2942] Q: Inspector Ridge, at the crime scene were there any drawings found on the ground or in the trees? </p><p id = "prosecution">[2943] A: No drawings, no sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[2944] Q: Okay.

I know, the question number 19 -- his answer -- or the question was, "Have you ever wondered what it would be like to kill someone even if you didn't go through with it?" And I believe the answer is on 19, "Only out of anger. To beat someone up. Whatever you do comes back to you three times, so does good." </p><p id = "prosecution">[3008] A: I remember that portion. I don't have that typed response to that question. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3009] Q: Okay. Alright, did you ask him two different questions about, if -- why would his fingerprints be out at the scene? Question number 29 states, "Why would your fingerprints be at the scene?" </p><p id = "prosecution">[3010] A: Yes sir. I didn't ask him that question, lieutenant Sudbury may have. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3011] Q: Okay.

Sudbury's response to 20. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3016] A: Yes sir, he typed that he had never been in the woods. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3017] Q: Also, question number 12 on the questionnaire dealt with, "Where were you on Wednesday May the 5th, 1993, between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M.?" </p><p id = "prosecution">[3018] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3019] Q: Okay. Did you ask Mr. Echols where he was after 10 P.M.? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3020] A: On the first page of the handwritten notes it begins with Tuesday. These are the questions that I asked him. I asked his recollection of where he was at Tuesday. Where he was on Wednesday. And he explains to me that shortly after he returned from the Sanders on a visit, he had gotten on the phone with Holly George and talked with her until 11:30 P.M. and was there the rest of the night. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3021] Q: Okay. Specifically, as far as the question that is type written, "Where were you on Wednesday May the 5th between 6 P.M. and 10 P.M.?" Was that a time period that you asked most of the suspects that y'all interviewed during this investigation? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3022] A: Again, I didn't use that questionnaire. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3023] Q: Do you recall if you asked any of the suspects where they were between 1 A.M. and 5 or 6 A.M. on May the 6th? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3024] A: I don't remember asking anybody that specific question, no sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3025] Q: Okay, thank you.

And he told you, I think, it was Anton LaVey and Stephen King? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3042] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3043] Q: Okay. In your opinion, is there anything unusual about those being the type of books that Mr. Echols likes to read? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3044] A: Anton LaVey is a book of Satanic rules and involvement. Stephen King seems to be horror movies, horror books, and if you're asking if I felt that was strange, yes sir, I did. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3045] Q: Alright. As part of your investigation did you have a search warrant executed on the Crittenden County Library to find out what library books Damien Echols has been reading? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3046] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3047] Q: Okay. Was this also part of the -- your theory to see if this was some type of cult related killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3048] A: It was an effort to find out what type of books that Damien had been reading. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3049] Q: Matter of fact, was this something that was suggested by your -- the expert that y'all had consulted in this case? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3050] A: Not to me, no sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3051] Q: Okay. You did have an affidavit for a search warrant that was executed before Judge Pal Rainey.

Bottom paragraph, first line. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3060] A: Yes sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3061] Q: So it's –- is your opinion that the murders were – appear to have been influenced by cult beliefs or religion, but there was nothing -– was there anything found at the crime scene indicating that this has been a cult killing? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3062] A: Yes sir, I would say so. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3063] Q: Alright. And what was that? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3064] A: Do you want me to answer that question? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3065] Q: I want you to say what you found out at the crime scene that indicated that this was a cult related killing. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3066] A: Okay sir. </p><p id = "defense">[3067] FORD: Approach the bench? </p><p id = "defense">[3068] THE COURT: Alright. </p><p id = "defense">[3069] (Bench conference) </p><p id = "defense">[3070] FORD: Your Honor, at this point that court order is not worth the piece of paper it's written on with the way things proceeding.

Alright gentlemen, this is the second time we've moved the jury out of the courtroom and -- so whatever record you wanna make. </p><p id = "defense">[3105] FORD: Your Honor, this court entered an order stating that the State of Arkansas, its counsels and witnesses would be prohibited from going into the occultic nature of any motive, or that this was an occult type killing until they can establish in camera that that -- there's a basis for that. Your Honor, the State and counsel for Echols have violated that order. You have allowed that violation despite our objections. There has been no testimony to establish that there is any rational basis for the opinions that this witness is trying to espouse about this being an occult killing, that it's motivated by the occult, that there were symbols found outside out there.

He didn't say he was gonna do it, he said his decision at that time -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[3128] THE COURT: And I also told you, before they put a so-called expert on the occult that we'll have an additional in camera hearing. </p><p id = "defense">[3129] FORD: Your Honor, We ask that his opinions be stricken, and that he not be allowed to give his opinions unless he's a so-called expert. </p><p id = "defense">[3130] WADLEY: There's no foundation. </p><p id = "defense">[3131] THE COURT: I'll sustain your objection to this witness giving an opinion as to whether or not it was an occult killing -- </p><p id = "defense">[3132] PRICE: Judge -- </p><p id = "defense">[3133] THE COURT: -- if that's what you're asking. </p><p id = "defense">[3134] PRICE: On behalf of Mr. Echols we object to that.

If you want another hearing before the so-called expert testifies I'll give you that. </p><p id = "defense">[3140] FORD: Well then, your Honor, until that time we'd ask that -- they elicited all the statements, that are out -- that they -- </p><p id = "defense">[3141] THE COURT: I don't know any trial where I wouldn't let the prosecution put on the statements of an accused. They were limited in that they could not put on any statement by Mr. Echols that linked Mr. Baldwin to anything.

We've had five days of testimony, the State hadn't put any of that on. I would like to know -- </p><p id = "defense">[3151] THE COURT: They made no effort to do so until today and then the only effort I saw, if you can even call it an effort, was asking a witness to describe the physical characteristics of the defendant which included some tattoos or markings on his body -- </p><p id = "defense">[3152] PRICE: But the last question I asked -- </p><p id = "defense">[3153] THE COURT: -- to me that didn't go into the occult. </p><p id = "defense">[3154] PRICE: The last question I asked the officer, What physical evidence at the crime scene dealt with this being an occult killing, and that's when the objection was made. And I think I'm entitled -- </p><p id = "defense">[3155] THE COURT: You wanna ask him, we're making an offer of proof, let me say what he's got to say. </p><p id = "defense">[3156] UNKNOWN: What -- </p><p id = "defense">[3157] THE COURT: Ask him. </p><p id = "defense">[3158] PRICE: Alright. Officer Ridge, what -- I believe the last question that I had asked was if there was any evidence out at the crime scene that indicated that this was a cult related killing. And I believe you haven't answered -- go ahead and give you answer. </p><p id = "defense">[3159] THE COURT: You asked if you're sure you want him to answer that, or something like that before he did it. </p><p id = "defense">[3160] PRICE: That's fine. </p><p id = "defense">[3161] A: Several indications at the crime scene convinced me that it is a cult related killing. One of those being the fact that it was an overkill. The fact there was way more injuries than was necessary to actually kill the children. There was torture involved. The removal of the penis, a penis is a symbol of power according to Damien's own statement. Placement in water. Water is -- has satanic symbolism according to Damien's own statement. The eight year-olds -- </p><p id = "defense">[3162] (gap in audio) </p><p id = "defense">[3163] A: -- are that items are to be returned three-fold, three as a satanic importance and symbolism. Crossroads area meaning neither in the middle of a community but nor in the extremes of nature. It's sort of a neither in the city or out of the city. Neither public nor completely private. Cult meetings -- most cult meetings or rituals are held in deserted isolated areas, wooded areas away from people. In blood rituals, many times parts of the victim are removed, possible eaten, or kept for use in other ways. The notation being that the penis was not found. The bodies were in the nude, the satanic term for that would be "skyclad." Stab wounds, patterns, may have been done for the purpose of bloodletting. Incisions to the sex organs or mutilations, cuts and bruises. Being a clean site, satanic or occult symbolism would mean that a clean site would have been noted. Injury patterns -- most sites would be on private property, this is private property, it's not public property, not normally travelled. The mutilation. Sex organs will be mutilated or removed. Their victims will be males, penis or testicles will be removed. The eyes will be gouged -- </p><p id = "defense">[3164] FORD: Is he -- is it -- are these his opinions or someone, someone that has given information to you? </p><p id = "defense">[3165] A: These are some notes I've taken from some research I've done in the occult. </p><p id = "defense">[3166] FORD: Is he gonna be established as an expert in the occult? </p><p id = "defense">[3167] THE COURT: If you're objecting to his testimony I'm not gonna allow it. </p><p id = "defense">[3168] FORD: I'm objecting to this testimony. Every word of it. </p><p id = "defense">[3169] THE COURT: I'm not gonna allow it at this time. It may be at a point in the trial where I will allow it. I can rule, based on what I've heard already, that the probative value of the occult or so-called occult testimony outweighs any possible prejudice. That the State at this point is entitled to prove motivation if they can, and if it's their choice to attempt to prove motivation as a means of an occult or satanic or ritual, or whatever, even just the motivation was as a result of the belief and -- some unnatural -- then I'm gonna allow him to do that. But if you're objecting to this particular witness testifying to his opinions or conclusions, then I'm gonna sustain the objection. </p><p id = "defense">[3170] FORD: I am your Honor, but are you saying that based on his opinions you're reaching that ruling? What evidence are -- </p><p id = "defense">[3171] THE COURT: No. </p><p id = "defense">[3172] FORD -- you reaching that ruling on? </p><p id = "defense">[3173] THE COURT: Based upon the information that was put into evidence.

I think that's sufficient to open a reasonable person's mind. </p><p id = "defense">[3174] FORD: Even to Jason Baldwin -- </p><p id = "defense">[3175] THE COURT: No, I've already ruled it doesn't apply to Jason Baldwin until it's connected in some way.

There was no objection made until long after that response as a matter of fact. </p><p id = "defense">[3187] WADLEY: Is that why the Court is denying that request? </p><p id = "defense">[3188] THE COURT: Now wait a minute, what request? </p><p id = "defense">[3189] WADLEY: Is that why the Court's denying our request that the jury be instructed to disregard his opinion?

You did that earlier when the statements were from Michael Carson, that they were not to be considered as to Damien Echols, and now we would ask that they not be considered -- </p><p id = "defense">[3203] THE COURT: I did it on this witness' testimony right before he started testifying. </p><p id = "defense">[3204] FORD: We're just asking that they be reminded that this testimony is not to be considered as evidence against Jason Baldwin. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3205] FOGLEMAN: At this time. </p><p id = "defense">[3206] FORD: We don't wanna say "at this time." </p><p id = "defense">[3207] THE COURT: That'll imply that at some later time it could be, which -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[3208] FOGLEMAN: Well, it could be at some later point. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3209] WADLEY: Judge, they have to -- if the order means anything, your Honor, they have to lay a foundation for this Court to cause some kind of - (Burnett coughs - unintelligible) - twenty-two.

Later between 3:00 and 5:00 P.M. he went to Randy and Susan Sanders' residence.  Then he said he went home after his mom had picked him up from Alexander's Laundry on Missouri Street. From there when he went home, he got on the telephone with (2402) Holly George.

Officer Ridge, on May 27, 1993, at approximately 5:17 (2404) P.M. did you conduct a photographic lineup with one Aaron Hutcheson? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3402] A.

Just shortly after that period of time, there were several interviews taking place. Those photographs were kept together in the (2405) office until the arrest was made.

Not to the murders at that particular time. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3429] Q. On May 27th Aaron Hutcheson was not an eyewitness to the murders? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3430] A.

Yes, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3433] Q. It is your testimony that you did not show him Damien Echols' picture? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3434] A. No, sir, that's not my testimony. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3435] Q. You do not remember if you showed him Damien's photograph. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3436] A. Yes, sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3437] Q. Murray Farris, Chris Littrell. Do you recall any other photographs you showed him on that day? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3438] A. I believe another person would be James Kenny Martin. And I'm not certain about a Michael or David Wynn, one of the twins. I'm not sure. But there are several others and I don't remember all the names. It was some photos I put together. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3439] Q. And the photographs -- there was a board that you had. You had the photographs placed on the board? </p><p id = "prosecution">[3440] A. That's correct. </p><p id = "prosecution">[3441] Q.
