As far as every item in there, there's no way humanly possible I can keep up with all of it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[72] Q: Did you ever -- to your knowledge, did anybody ever turn on a tape recorder and push that record button when anybody talked with my client, Damien Echols?</p><p id = "prosecution">[73] A: I don't know. You'd have to ask someone else. I don't know.</p><p id = "prosecution">[74] Q: Who were all the people that talked with my client?</p><p id = "prosecution">[75] A: I believe detective Ridge did. Detective Durham. That may have been the only two that I know of that talked to him.</p><p id = "prosecution">[76] Q: Would detective Sudbury also have talked with him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[77] A: I think he talked with him out on the street one day.</p><p id = "prosecution">[78] Q: Okay. Were any of those conversations to your knowledge recorded?</p><p id = "prosecution">[79] A: I don't know if they were or not.</p><p id = "prosecution">[80] Q: Did you also talk with my client, Damien Echols?</p><p id = "prosecution">[81] A: I talked with him for a short time, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[82] Q: Did you make any notes of those conversations?</p><p id = "prosecution">[83] A: It was a very informal sitting down and talking what he and I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[84] Q: So there are no notes of your conversation with him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[85] A: I don't recall.</p><p id = "prosecution">[86] Q: I believe you testified that you didn't record that also.</p><p id = "prosecution">[87] A: No.</p><p id = "prosecution">[88] Q: Is it your procedure in the West Memphis Police Department for interviews of suspects in a crime to be taped?</p><p id = "prosecution">[89] A: No, it's not a procedure to do that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[90] Q: It's not a procedure to do that? Would you agree with me if you had done that we would know exactly what the officers said and exactly what Damien Echols said?</p><p id = "prosecution">[91] A: Well, we've talked with several hundred people in regards to this investigation, so no it was not possible to do a recording of everyone. It's a man power, a personnel trying to get everything transcribed. No, it's impossible to do. We rely a lot on our personal notes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[92] Q: We'll get the transcribing here in a minute. But first of all I wanna ask you about the taping. Does it take a longer time for you to put a tape in a tape recorder and hit that button to where it would just be impossible for you to do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[93] A: No.</p><p id = "prosecution">[94] Q: These little tapes -- what do they cost about? $4 for six? Is that about right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[95] A: Let's see, you talking about cassette tapes? Mini cassette tapes?</p><p id = "prosecution">[96] Q: Well what kind of recorders do you all have in the West Memphis Police Department?</p><p id = "prosecution">[97] A: We have mini cassette tape. We got a large regular cassette tape also.</p><p id = "prosecution">[98] Q: How much would it have cost the West Memphis Police Department to tape record conversations with my client, Damien Echols?</p><p id = "prosecution">[99] A: Wouldn't have cost much.</p><p id = "prosecution">[100] Q: Wouldn't have cost much?</p><p id = "prosecution">[101] A: Un-uh.</p><p id = "prosecution">[102] Q: Would it have cost -- well strike that. So are you telling us that there really aren't any procedures for tape recording interviews?</p><p id = "prosecution">[103] A: That's basically opened up to an individual investigator.</p><p id = "prosecution">[104] Q: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[105] A: Do I instruct them to, make them to, no.</p><p id = "prosecution">[106] Q: Now, let's talk for a minute about the procedures in West Memphis Police Department for showing a photo line-up.</p><p id = "prosecution">[107] A: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[108] Q: Do you have set procedures in the West Memphis Police Department for showing a photo line-up?</p><p id = "prosecution">[109] A: Basically what we attempt to do is done several different ways. On occasions we do have a -- it's like a manila fold that has got the squares cut out.</p><p id = "prosecution">[110] Q: Do you have that with you here?</p><p id = "prosecution">[111] A: I don't know if it's right here. It's possibly in another vehicle that we brought all the evidence with us. I don't know if it's actually with this.</p><p id = "prosecution">[112] Q: Could you get that sometime today?</p><p id = "prosecution">[113] A: Sure.</p><p id = "prosecution">[114] Q: Is this like a cut out piece of mat board --</p><p id = "prosecution">[115] A: -- Well you didn't let me finish on the different ways. You asked how many ways --</p><p id = "prosecution">[116] Q: -- Okay --</p><p id = "prosecution">[117] A: That's one way we do it. There's also just a (mirror?) laying out of pictures with putting a number on the front of the picture. It's done that way sometimes. Then there's also a method of using our mug shot books, which we have several hundred photographs in our mug shot books, probably – I'm gonna guess, a 15 or 20 books that individuals also look at. So we have a lot of photographs.</p><p id = "prosecution">[118] Q: Is it a procedure of the West Memphis Police Department for you to write down the names of the pictures that you show to someone in a photo line-up?</p><p id = "prosecution">[119] A: If there was an identification made, yes we would.</p><p id = "prosecution">[120] Q: If there is no identification made, do you not write down the names of the people?</p><p id = "prosecution">[121] A: It would be good to do that, and I know what you're getting at. But yes, it would be good to do that, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[122] Q: You would agree with me that it could be exculpatory to someone? It would be a good thing for someone that was accused of a crime to know that they weren't identified in a photo line-up, wouldn't it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[123] A: To know that they were not identified?</p><p id = "prosecution">[124] Q: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[125] A: I guess you'd have to explain that a little better for me.</p><p id = "prosecution">[126] Q: Okay. If someone is accused of a crime, and you go out and show a witness a photo line-up, that person's picture in the photo line-up, and they do not pick anybody out, wouldn't it be important to tell this person that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[127] A: It would depend on what that photo line-up is for. Is it for identification purposes in this crime, or is it for identification purposes for another reason.</p><p id = "prosecution">[128] Q: Was a photo line-up shown in this crime?</p><p id = "prosecution">[129] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[130] Q: How many?</p><p id = "prosecution">[131] A: Possibly two.</p><p id = "prosecution">[132] Q: Possibly two. And, in those photo line-ups, was my client's picture included?</p><p id = "prosecution">[133] A: Well there's been a little debate about that. I understand -- I have an officer that is trying to recall if there was one or not. I was present at the time and I'm thinking that his picture was in that line-up.</p><p id = "prosecution">[134] Q: Y'all didn't write it down, so you just don't remember either way, is that correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[135] A: I'm saying I think his picture was in it, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[136] Q: It is also true that his picture was not picked out, isn't it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[137] A: Well, I can answer that a simple yes or no or be allowed some --</p><p id = "prosecution">[138] Q: I'm asking you yes or no.</p><p id = "prosecution">[139] A: I figured you would. Yes his picture was shown.</p><p id = "prosecution">[140] Q: But it was not picked out?</p><p id = "prosecution">[141] A: And it was not picked out.</p><p id = "prosecution">[142] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, one explanation that -- we'd like to be able to explain.</p><p id = "prosecution">[143] THE COURT: All right, explain if you need to.</p><p id = "prosecution">[144] A: Okay. His picture was shown to an 8-year-old boy. This 8-year-old boy was giving us information in regards to cult activity that he states he has witnessed. And the people were described as having all blackened out faces.</p><p id = "prosecution">[145] Q: But this 8-year-old boy did not pick him out, did he?</p><p id = "prosecution">[146] A: We didn't think that he would pick anyone out if their faces were totally black so we didn't expect. It was just strictly a shot in the dark.</p><p id = "prosecution">[147] Q: Okay --</p><p id = "prosecution">[148] THE COURT: Was anybody picked out?</p><p id = "prosecution">[149] A: Nobody was picked out, no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[150] Q: Let me ask you a little bit about your procedure for the handling of evidence. Is there a set procedure that the West Memphis Police Department has for the handling of evidence collected in this case?</p><p id = "prosecution">[151] A: Yes sir, detective Ridge for the most part took custody of evidence and made it and prepared it to go to the crime lab. We tried to have one particular officer to take items to the crime lab to cut down on the amount of officers that would be subpoenaed to court. We are a small department and we attempted to have as few officers involved as possible.</p><p id = "prosecution">[152] Q: Could you tell us what the procedure is when someone goes out and collects evidence, what happens with the evidence at that point?</p><p id = "prosecution">[153] A: Okay, he would take that evidence -- we use paper bags -- paper bags we purchase from grocery stores in town. We use those bag because they breaths. If you use a plastic bag, moisture is retained in that plastic bag and you can damage any possible evidence that you would put into a plastic bag.</p><p id = "prosecution">[154] Q: Where is it that you keep the evidence?</p><p id = "prosecution">[155] A: We would either keep it in -- we have an evidence vault in our detective division. Or in this particular case it was so large I utilized an office next to my office to keep the evidence in.</p><p id = "prosecution">[156] Q: Is that the closet area that adjoins your office?</p><p id = "prosecution">[157] A: Well now we have a detective in that office but --</p><p id = "prosecution">[158] Q: Okay --</p><p id = "prosecution">[159] A: -- you're familiar with where it's at.</p><p id = "prosecution">[160] Q: The evidence -- once it comes is placed in the evidence locker or the closet. If it's going to be sent to the crime lab, how is that handled?</p><p id = "prosecution">[161] A: Okay there's a form, that's an evidence admission form that belongs to the state crime lab which we fill this form out, we attach it to the bag. Ofcourse, when you pick a piece of evidence up you write down what type. If you give me a bag I can show you.</p><p id = "prosecution">[162] (Handing bag)</p><p id = "prosecution">[163] A: Okay, in this case, this one's marked E78, a black t-shirt from Damien Echols, date 6-3 of 93, the officer's initials, the case file number on it. Then it has subsequent markings on it which we did not apply but when evidence goes to the crime lab that is done on it, and the different people that handle it may put this on it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[164] Q: Okay thank you. Did officer -- or detective Ridge bring you evidence collected at the Bojangles restaurant?</p><p id = "prosecution">[165] A: Bring me?</p><p id = "prosecution">[166] Q: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[167] A: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[168] Q: To your knowledge, was an evidence submission sheet you just talked about ever completed sending anything to the Arkansas Crime Lab from evidence collected at the Bojangles restaurant?</p><p id = "prosecution">[169] A: As far as I know, no sir, it was never a form filled out. I believe what you're questioning about -- you've seen my office, you're familiar with my office with the one table there. During this case that table was full of different papers, documents, basically all throughout that office.</p><p id = "prosecution">[170] Q: When did you discover that the Bojangles blood evidence had been lost?</p><p id = "prosecution">[171] A: I believe it was when it came up in Corning.</p><p id = "prosecution">[172] Q: And that's the first that you knew that this evidence had been lost?</p><p id = "prosecution">[173] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[174] Q: Were you awaiting that evidence to come back from the crime lab?</p><p id = "prosecution">[175] A: No sir, it was as the term is, lost.</p><p id = "prosecution">[176] Q: Now, so as far as your procedures for collecting that -- in this case it was to bring it in and put it on your table in your office?</p><p id = "prosecution">[177] A: That's correct.</p><p id = "prosecution">[178] Q: Now, let me ask you a little bit about the procedures of the West Memphis Police Department for audio and video surveillance. In this case -- first of all, do you have a set procedure for audio and video surveillance?</p><p id = "prosecution">[179] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[180] Q: And what is that procedure?</p><p id = "prosecution">[181] A: We would get permission from the individual if we were in someone's home. Or we would get a permission from that person in order to do that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[182] Q: Did you have audio and video surveilla-- audio surveillance in this particular case?</p><p id = "prosecution">[183] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[184] Q: And where was that audio surveillance?</p><p id = "prosecution">[185] A: We did one at Vicki Hutcheson's residence. And then we also set out on the skating ring parking lot in West Memphis and did a surveillance of that also.</p><p id = "prosecution">[186] Q: Tell us what kind of equipment that you used there with the audio surveillance at Vicki Hutcheson's house?</p><p id = "prosecution">[187] A: Okay what we have is a transmitting device which was connected to an outdoor repeater and the signal would be transmitted with that repeater and could be received by us with walkie talkies and also with recording device.</p><p id = "prosecution">[188] Q: So you had a recording device, a transmitter, and receivers --</p><p id = "prosecution">[189] A: Right.</p><p id = "prosecution">[190] Q: Were one of those receivers in your office?</p><p id = "prosecution">[191] A: No not my office.</p><p id = "prosecution">[192] Q: Not in your office? At the police station?</p><p id = "prosecution">[193] A: At the police station. Any -- there's several radios that we have, walkie talkie radios with that channel affixed in the radio, that you can receive that particular frequency on.</p><p id = "prosecution">[194] Q: So you had equipment where it would be placed in a home and you could listen in at the police station?</p><p id = "prosecution">[195] A: Right. Depending on a lot of factors. But we were able to, yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[196] Q: Did you -- first of all, was Vicki Hutcheson working for the West Memphis Police Department in this investigation?</p><p id = "prosecution">[197] A: Initially, no she was not. We were not aware -- we were not even aware of her.</p><p id = "prosecution">[198] Q: Did she work with the West Memphis Police Department in this investigation?</p><p id = "prosecution">[199] FOGLEMAN: Did you say "With" or "for"?</p><p id = "defense">[200] DAVIDSON: I'm saying "with."</p><p id = "defense">[201] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[202] Q: And Vicki Hutcheson, is she the person you had the audio surveillance in her home?</p><p id = "defense">[203] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[204] Q: Isn't it true that the purpose of this audio surveillance was to try to catch my client saying something that you could use against him?</p><p id = "defense">[205] A: That's correct.</p><p id = "defense">[206] Q: And you indeed did have a hook-up there at her house?</p><p id = "defense">[207] A: You mean the device there?</p><p id = "defense">[208] Q: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[209] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[210] Q: How long was it there?</p><p id = "defense">[211] A: I think just that one -- actual use time, just that one day or one evening, if I recall correctly.</p><p id = "defense">[212] Q: When was it placed in --</p><p id = "defense">[213] A: I couldn't tell you the actual date. It would have been placed in possibly one evening and then actually utilized the next evening.</p><p id = "defense">[214] Q: Do you have notes saying what equipment was put in there, when it was put in there, when it was taken out?</p><p id = "defense">[215] A: Yes sir, no -- well detective Sudbury, lieutenant Sudbury, he was the officer that handled that. I personally did not. </p><p id = "defense">[216] Q: Are you familiar -- and do you think that there are notes saying when it was put in, what equipment was put in and that sort of thing? When it was taken out?</p><p id = "defense">[217] A: There should be a form which we have gotten permission from Ms. Hutcheson to do this. Exactly what the dates are or what is on it I'm not aware of. As I said that would be lieutenant Sudbury handled that, so I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[218] Q: Did you ever oversee his placing this surveillance in there?</p><p id = "defense">[219] A: No sir.</p><p id = "defense">[220] Q: You're just saying we'll have to ask him about that?</p><p id = "defense">[221] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[222] Q: Okay. Are there set procedures for doing that in the West Memphis Police Department?</p><p id = "defense">[223] A: Other than --</p><p id = "defense">[224] Q: For documenting that?</p><p id = "defense">[225] A: Just what I've described to you.</p><p id = "defense">[226] Q: This equipment -- you think it cost more than audio tapes?</p><p id = "defense">[227] A: Oh yeah.</p><p id = "defense">[228] Q: How long was this surveillance out there and in use? I've already asked how long it was out there and you didn't know, but how long was it in use, do you know that?</p><p id = "defense">[229] A: For several hours, and it got to a point that we just turned it off.</p><p id = "defense">[230] Q: And isn't it true that my client was on this surveillance?</p><p id = "defense">[231] A: That I don't know, I could not -- I could not say. I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[232] Q: Did y'all transcribe this?</p><p id = "defense">[233] A: It was impossible to do that.</p><p id = "defense">[234] Q: Do you normally transcribe statements?</p><p id = "defense">[235] A: If they're audible and understandable.</p><p id = "defense">[236] Q: Do you often work with other police departments in investigation of crimes?</p><p id = "defense">[237] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[238] Q: In this particular investigation did you work with the Marion Police Department?</p><p id = "defense">[239] A: Later on in it, yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[240] Q: Later on in it?</p><p id = "defense">[241] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[242] Q: Do you know a man named Don Bray?</p><p id = "defense">[243] A: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[244] Q: Where does he work?</p><p id = "defense">[245] A: Marion Police Department.</p><p id = "defense">[246] Q: Did Don Bray provide you notes in his part of the investigation?</p><p id = "defense">[247] A: He provided a couple of tapes which we have transcribed and given to you.</p><p id = "defense">[248] Q: Did he provide you any handwritten notes?</p><p id = "defense">[249] A: I don't recall any handwritten notes, no sir.</p><p id = "defense">[250] (Pause)</p><p id = "defense">[251] Q: Finally officer, there has been a knife that has been marked for identification purposes as E6.
