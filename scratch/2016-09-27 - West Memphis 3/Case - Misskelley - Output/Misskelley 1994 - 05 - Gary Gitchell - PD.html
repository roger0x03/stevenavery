I'm the Inspector for the West Memphis Police Department, Criminal Investigative Division.</p><p id = "prosecution">[8] FOGLEMAN: Inspector Gitchell, how long have you been with the West Memphis Police Department?</p><p id = "prosecution">[9] GITCHELL: Umm, nineteen and a half years.</p><p id = "prosecution">[10] FOGLEMAN: Inspector Gitchell, I want to direct your attention to June the 3rd, 1993. On that date, did you have an occasion to have a conversation with the defendant, Jessie Misskelley, Jr.?</p><p id = "prosecution">[11] GITCHELL: Yes sir, I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[12] FOGLEMAN: And was, was that, who was present when you had this conversation?</p><p id = "prosecution">[13] GITCHELL: Myself and Detective Ridge.</p><p id = "prosecution">[14] FOGLEMAN: And approximately what time did you begin talking to him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[15] GITCHELL: Uh, let's see, that was approximately 12:40pm.</p><p id = "prosecution">[16] FOGLEMAN: And during the course of your conversation, uhh, with this defendant, uh, initially, uh, were you doing anything to preserve the conversation? Yourself?</p><p id = "prosecution">[17] GITCHELL: Uh, the -- no sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[18] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Was Detective Ridge?</p><p id = "prosecution">[19] GITCHELL: Uh, no sir. Not that I know of. He may have been taking some notes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[20] FOGLEMAN: Okay. Why were you not taking notes at that time?</p><p id = "prosecution">[21] GITCHELL: Well, when I talk with someone I usually do not like to, for the purpose, I like to key on and be able to listen and have my complete attention as to the conversation.</p><p id = "prosecution">[22] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, during the course of this conversation, um, was there, um, let me ask you this way. Was there a photograph shown the defendant?</p><p id = "prosecution">[23] GITCHELL: Yes sir, it was.</p><p id = "prosecution">[24] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Uh, was there a small portion of a tape played for the defendant?</p><p id = "prosecution">[25] GITCHELL: Yes sir, there was.</p><p id = "prosecution">[26] FOGLEMAN: And was there something about a circle?</p><p id = "prosecution">[27] GITCHELL: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[28] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now was that done before or after you started tape recording?</p><p id = "prosecution">[29] GITCHELL: That was before we started tape recording.</p><p id = "prosecution">[30] FOGLEMAN: And do you recall the sequence of what took place when?</p><p id = "prosecution">[31] GITCHELL: Uh, during Detective Ridge and I's, uh conversation with Mr. Misskelley, uh there was a, I believe -- I hope this is right -- there was a, the diagram which I did, and then the picture and then the tape.</p><p id = "prosecution">[32] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Were they one behind the other or were things in between?</p><p id = "prosecution">[33] GITCHELL: Uh, there was some in between from the diagram, was the first thing. Then some time passed. And then there was the picture, um, just a few minutes passed from that point to the tape. </p><p id = "prosecution">[34] FOGLEMAN: Okay. Now on the diagram, describe to the jury what this, what this was, this diagram.</p><p id = "prosecution">[35] GITCHELL: Okay, um, a lot, I'm assuming a lot of people may be familiar with um a term, straddling the fence.</p><p id = "prosecution">[36] FOGLEMAN: Um-hmm.</p><p id = "prosecution">[37] GITCHELL: And that was sort of along the lines that I was thinking uh, when talking to someone that you do not feel is telling you the complete truth. Uh, quit straddling the fence, be on one side of it or the other. Uh, I did something a little different, in so much as I drew a circle, and I had several dots within that circle and several dots outside.</p><p id = "prosecution">[38] FOGLEMAN: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[39] GITCHELL: And I asked, which side is he going to be on, on this outside or the inside.</p><p id = "prosecution">[40] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now who's inside the circle? </p><p id = "prosecution">[41] GITCHELL: Uh, no one in particular. No one named or, um, but I, I indicated that law enforcement was on the outside of the circle.</p><p id = "prosecution">[42] FOGLEMAN: Alright. In general, what was on the inside?</p><p id = "prosecution">[43] GITCHELL: Uh, in general, uh, just who was responsible for these crimes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[44] FOGLEMAN: Alright. When you did this diagram, did you say these dots inside represent a particular named individual or individuals?</p><p id = "prosecution">[45] GITCHELL: No sir. </p><p id = "prosecution">[46] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And what did you do with the circle and the dots?</p><p id = "prosecution">[47] GITCHELL: Uh, you mean afterwards or? Just pretty much like I did then, just did it on a piece of paper and that was it. </p><p id = "prosecution">[48] FOGLEMAN: (interrupting) Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[49] GITCHELL: And, of course, showed that to Jessie 'cause he was right there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[50] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And when you showed it to him, what happened, what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[51] GITCHELL: Uh he, he immediately said that uh, he wanted to be on the outside of the circle with the law enforcement.</p><p id = "prosecution">[52] FOGLEMAN: Okay. And, um, and then I take it you had some more conversation.</p><p id = "prosecution">[53] GITCHELL: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[54] FOGLEMAN: And then what took place?</p><p id = "prosecution">[55] GITCHELL: Uh, a short time later, uh, I stepped out of the room, uh...</p><p id = "prosecution">[56] FOGLEMAN: (inaudible) before you, alright is that when you got the picture --</p><p id = "prosecution">[57] GITCHELL: (interrupting) Yes sir --</p><p id = "prosecution">[58] FOGLEMAN: -- when you stepped out of the room? Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[59] GITCHELL: I stepped out of the office that we were talking to Jessie in, and um, got this picture, and then also I remembered a recording, uh, of a phrase, just only a phrase, I believe probably a four to five second phrase within that recorded statement that I wanted to play for Jessie.</p><p id = "prosecution">[60] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And the voice on this tape, without naming names uh, how old of a person was this on the tape?</p><p id = "prosecution">[61] GITCHELL: Uh, eight years old.</p><p id = "prosecution">[62] FOGLEMAN: Okay. And are you aware of whether or not the defendant, uh, knew, knew the person whose voice it was?</p><p id = "prosecution">[63] GITCHELL: The information that we had was that he is familiar with the eight-year-old boy. </p><p id = "prosecution">[64] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, when you came back in the room, uh, I want to show you State's Exhibit 76 and ask if you recognize that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[65] GITCHELL: Yes sir, this is the, um, photograph that I showed Jessie. It has the number 3 on the front of the photograph, and on the back it's number 107.</p><p id = "prosecution">[66] FOGLEMAN: Okay. And what was the response to the photograph?</p><p id = "prosecution">[67] GITCHELL: When I showed Jessie this photograph and he took it into his hand, and he just, he just went back in his chair like this. And, and he just locked in on it, fixed in on the photograph, and just kept staring at it and staring at it. And I could tell that he just was -- I didn't know how long he was going to do that. So I, I took it from his hand, and set it on the table that we were working on.</p><p id = "prosecution">[68] FOGLEMAN: Okay. And then what happened? </p><p id = "prosecution">[69] GITCHELL: Briefly, just a few minutes after that, of course I um had the tape, which I do have that tape with me at this time -- </p><p id = "prosecution">[70] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Your Honor --</p><p id = "prosecution">[71] GITCHELL: -- and I played this small portion of that tape. </p><p id = "prosecution">[72] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we would ask permission to play that portion of the tape.</p><p id = "prosecution">[73] THE COURT: Alright. You will be permitted to do so. </p><p id = "prosecution">[74] GITCHELL: This may take a little, you know, problems I had.</p><p id = "prosecution">[75] (squeaky speeding up of tape noise)</p><p id = "prosecution">[76] TAPE: Nobody knows what happened but me, out of all -- (clicked off)</p><p id = "prosecution">[77] GITCHELL: Should I do that again, your Honor?</p><p id = "prosecution">[78] THE COURT: I think so. </p><p id = "prosecution">[79] TAPE: Nobody knows what happened by me, out of -- (clicked off)</p><p id = "prosecution">[80] FOGLEMAN: Okay, what, what did he say for the jurors that didn't pick it, catch it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[81] GITCHELL: He said, "Nobody knows what happened but me."</p><p id = "prosecution">[82] FOGLEMAN: Okay. Alright. And when you played this tape, what was the defendant's response?</p><p id = "prosecution">[83] GITCHELL: He, he immediately stated that he wanted to tell us about it, at that point.</p><p id = "prosecution">[84] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And um, at some point thereafter did Detective Ridge leave the room?</p><p id = "prosecution">[85] GITCHELL: Yes sir, he did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[86] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And uh, while Detective Ridge was out of the room, what took place?</p><p id = "prosecution">[87] GITCHELL: Uh, at that point, uh, Jessie indicated to me that uh, he was present during that time that the boys were murdered.</p><p id = "prosecution">[88] FOGLEMAN: Okay. Now was there (cough) had there been some statement, uh, or what statements if any did the defendant make in your presence about having been, uh, at the scene? </p><p id = "prosecution">[89] GITCHELL: He, he had stated earlier that he had been at the scene, um, that um, also that he had gone back to the scene...</p><p id = "prosecution">[90] FOGLEMAN: Alright, you said gone back. Were those his words?</p><p id = "prosecution">[91] GITCHELL: Yes. </p><p id = "prosecution">[92] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Did he say that before or after, uh, he admitted being there when it took place? </p><p id = "prosecution">[93] GITCHELL: Uh, let's see. I, it may have been before. </p><p id = "prosecution">[94] FOGLEMAN: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[95] GITCHELL: It, it does get a little confusing, even for me.</p><p id = "prosecution">[96] FOGLEMAN: Alright. What did he say about when he went back to the scene?</p><p id = "prosecution">[97] GITCHELL: That, uh, he went out into the woods, where this occurred, the murders, and he set out and cried.</p><p id = "prosecution">[98] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And uhh, after he admitted to you that he had been there, um, or I may be jumping ahead of myself. Now tell me again what he said to you while he was, while Detective Ridge was out of the room.</p><p id = "prosecution">[99] GITCHELL: That uh, he was, he was present when the, the boys were murdered.</p><p id = "prosecution">[100] FOGLEMAN: Alright. And after he admitted to you that he was present, what was the defendant's response?</p><p id = "prosecution">[101] GITCHELL: Uh, basically, uh, I stopped him at that point.</p><p id = "prosecution">[102] FOGLEMAN: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[103] GITCHELL: And uh, then I wanted to make sure it, it was obvious at this time we had more than just uh, a person that we were trying to get information from as to other parties. Uh, it was obvious to us that uh, we had a person here that uh, was involved.</p><p id = "prosecution">[104] FOGLEMAN: Was there any kind of emotional response?</p><p id = "prosecution">[105] GITCHELL: Uh, from Jessie?</p><p id = "prosecution">[106] FOGLEMAN: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[107] GITCHELL: Uh, well he was emotionally upset, you could tell that, uh, it was an emotional time for myself also.</p><p id = "prosecution">[108] FOGLEMAN: Alright, when you say it was emotional for him and you could tell it, what told you that --</p><p id = "prosecution">[109] GITCHELL: Well he had, he had tears coming down his eyes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[110] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Had y'all yelled at him or been mean to him or --</p><p id = "prosecution">[111] GITCHELL: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[112] FOGLEMAN: -- threatened him or promised him anything, done any of those things?</p><p id = "prosecution">[113] GITCHELL: None of those things happened whatsoever. </p><p id = "prosecution">[114] FOGLEMAN: Alright, now after he admitted to being there, what did you do in order to preserve the conversation?</p><p id = "prosecution">[115] GITCHELL: Okay, uh, I instructed that uh, Detective Ridge, I went out to the room said we need to get a tape recorder which is, this is the identical tape recorder that was used. Uh, the tape recorder was brought into the room, myself and Detective Ridge at that point, we advised him of his rights for the third time that day.</p><p id = "prosecution">[116] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now before you go on, I want to hand you what I've marked for identification purposes as State's Exhibit 75A and ask if you can identify that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[117] GITCHELL: Yes sir, this is a uh typed transcript of that taped interview. </p><p id = "prosecution">[118] FOGLEMAN: And does that transcript fairly portray what it said on the tape?</p><p id = "prosecution">[119] GITCHELL: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[120] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we would offer uh 75A and we would -- do you have the tape too, by the way?</p><p id = "prosecution">[121] GITCHELL: Yes sir, uh, I believe your table has the tape. </p><p id = "prosecution">[122] FOGLEMAN: Oh, I see. Let me show you what's marked State's Exhibit 75 and ask if you can identify that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[123] GITCHELL: This package is one in which, uh, I did fill the information out on this package. It has the date on it, the case file number, Jessie Misskelley Jr., uh stating that this is the original tape. And it has Ridge and Gitchell for the interviewers of that. And this tape is also marked on the outside. </p><p id = "prosecution">[124] FOGLEMAN: Is that the tape of your conversation from the time that Jessie first admitted that he was present, uh, up until there was a break?</p><p id = "prosecution">[125] GITCHELL: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[126] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Your Honor, we would offer State's Exhibit 75. </p><p id = "prosecution">[127] THE COURT: Alright, it may be received.</p><p id = "prosecution">[128] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, on 75A, was that admitted?</p><p id = "defense">[129] STIDHAM: Your Honor, that's just the front page of the transcript. </p><p id = "prosecution">[130] FOGLEMAN: That's the, that's the transcript.</p><p id = "defense">[131] STIDHAM: (inaudible) the entire transcript?</p><p id = "prosecution">[132] FOGLEMAN: To aid and assist the jury as they listen along.
