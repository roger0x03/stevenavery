property. In the absence of any allegation regarding motive, mere opportunity is
insufficient to justify admission of the third party liability evidence.

In summary, with the exception of Scott Tadych and Andres Martinez, the
other persons identiﬁed by the defendant may have had an opportunity to commit
some or all ofthe crimes charged in the sense that they were near the alleged crime
scene at the time ofthe alleged crimes. The defense fails to offer any meaningful
evidence, however, to suggest that any of the persons named were directly
connected to the crimes in any way. In the absence of motive. it certainly may be
more difficult for the defendant to offer evidence which is relevant and material
connecting a third person to the crime. The court simply finds nothing in the offer
made by the defendant that goes beyond the level of speculation.

ORDER

The defense is precludcd from offering any direct evidence that a third party,
other than Brendan Dassey, participated in the commission of the crimes charged
in the Amended Information.
