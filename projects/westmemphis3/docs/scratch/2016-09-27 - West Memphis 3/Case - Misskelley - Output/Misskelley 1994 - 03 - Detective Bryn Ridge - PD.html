Now, what part if any, did you play in the investigation of the disappearance of Michael Moore, Stevie Branch and Chris Byers?</p><p id = "prosecution">[11] RIDGE: I participated in the search for the missing juveniles. And also in the discovery of the bodies.</p><p id = "prosecution">[12] FOGLEMAN: Uh, approximately what time did you begin your search efforts?</p><p id = "prosecution">[13] RIDGE: About 7:30 AM that morning</p><p id = "prosecution">[14] FOGLEMAN: And what area were you assigned to search?</p><p id = "prosecution">[15] RIDGE: I went first to Robin Hood Hills, this park on north McCauley.</p><p id = "prosecution">[16] FOGLEMAN: And, if you would, if you take the pointer and just point to the area that you went to.</p><p id = "prosecution">[17] RIDGE: (pointing) I went here, into this area of Robin Hood Hills.</p><p id = "prosecution">[18] FOGLEMAN: How far in did you go?</p><p id = "prosecution">[19] RIDGE: Uh, there is a hill, this is a pipe you cross right here of this bayou ditch there is a hill you can see a path coming across that hill, I went to just into the woods right there by that path.</p><p id = "prosecution">[20] FOGLEMAN: Was there anybody else in the woods?</p><p id = "prosecution">[21] RIDGE: Yes sir, there was one other person.</p><p id = "prosecution">[22] FOGLEMAN: Who was that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[23] RIDGE: It was a young man on a bicycle that was searching, hollering for the kids also.</p><p id = "prosecution">[24] FOGLEMAN: I want to show you what's marked for identification as State's Exhibit 13 and ask if you can identify that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[25] RIDGE: Yes sir, that's a diagram of a area known as Robin Hood Hills.</p><p id = "prosecution">[26] FOGLEMAN : Your honor we would offer State's Exhibit 13.</p><p id = "defense">[27] STIDHAM: No objection Your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[28] THE COURT: Alright, it may be received without objection.</p><p id = "prosecution">[29] FOGLEMAN: Now on the diagram, of course it's not 3 dimensional so you can't show the hills, but where is it exactly that you went?</p><p id = "prosecution">[30] RIDGE: (pointing) Across this pipe, I parked my vehicle here, across this pipe, walked up this trail, there was another trail that's somewhat dimmer than this trail that went across a hill and it comes to this point right in here. That's where I went to.</p><p id = "prosecution">[31] FOGLEMAN: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[32] FOGLEMAN: You can retake the stand.</p><p id = "prosecution">[33] FOGLEMAN: Alright now, about what time of the day was that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[34] RIDGE: That would have been early, probably at about 8:00 in the morning.</p><p id = "prosecution">[35] FOGLEMAN: And then where did you go?</p><p id = "prosecution">[36] RIDGE: Then the search just scattered from there. I actually searched the weeded area that's west of there to 7th street and then from 7th street back to my vehicle and just (FOGLEMAN interrupts)</p><p id = "prosecution">[37] FOGLEMAN: Alright, the jury is not going to know where 7th street is, so if you could take down the crime scene diagram and if the aerial photographs shows the area where you searched then if could you point that out to the jury.</p><p id = "prosecution">[38] RIDGE: Okay. (Pointing) This is 7th street actually and the north would be downward on this map as it's shown. When I went to here, I yelled for the boys, or looked for the bicycles or whatever I could find. I couldn't find anything, so I made my way all the way through this weeded patch, you got hills, ditches, culverts all the way to 7th street and then I crossed the bayou and I came all the way back through this weeded group area here, back to my vehicle and just continued to search from there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[39] FOGLEMAN: Alright, and then where did you go sir?</p><p id = "prosecution">[40] RIDGE: (Pointing) Uh, I searched all into this area from this little street here, you'll come into this path and you'll walk around this way, and these paths are all connected. I searched all of these woods into this area. I searched this big wooded area here that, this is just a big thicket there are no paths really that go through it, you just have to dig your way through the vines. And then by the time I made my way back to my vehicle again, it was determined that I went and got my 3 wheeler and actually did some searching on 3 wheeler.</p><p id = "prosecution">[41] FOGLEMAN: Alright, when you were out searching that area were there other people searching too?</p><p id = "prosecution">[42] RIDGE: Yes (talking over each other)</p><p id = "prosecution">[43] FOGLEMAN: Approximately how many people did you see searching?</p><p id = "prosecution">[44] RIDGE: I saw probably 15 people. </p><p id = "prosecution">[45] FOGLEMAN: Alright, in that area?</p><p id = "prosecution">[46] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[47] FOGLEMAN: Okay, and after you got your 3 wheeler where did you go?</p><p id = "prosecution">[48] RIDGE: (Pointing) Okay, when I got my 3 wheeler I parked on Wal-Mart parking lot which is about another mile to the west if you go down the expressway and just a little bit to the south of the expressway. I got on the 3 wheeler I searched all the way around this field and to the back of this lot. Of course this is about a 200 acre field and I came all the way through there. I took my 3 wheeler and came back through this area again, came back out on this street. Then I went on the east side of this ditch and started hunting the edge and looking the edges of all of these fields.</p><p id = "prosecution">[49] FOGLEMAN: Now, uh, at some point later on did you receive some kind of word that you needed to go, back to the area of Robin Hood?</p><p id = "prosecution">[50] RIDGE: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[51] FOGLEMAN: Alright, and what did you do after you got that word?</p><p id = "prosecution">[52] RIDGE: Okay, that's when I immediately left from Airport Road, which is a good 3 miles away from that scene actually, and by the time I got there is was about 1:30 and the bodies were discovered shortly after I arrived.</p><p id = "prosecution">[53] FOGLEMAN: Alright, now after you arrived what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[54] RIDGE: I talked with Mike Allen who explained how he had been in the ditch attempting to retrieve some of the clothing items. Those items being floated, floating in the water. I think there were shoes and a hat and he explained to me how upon searching for that body he had found or searching for those clothes, going to those clothes he had found a body.</p><p id = "prosecution">[55] FOGLEMAN: Alright, now after receiving that information what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[56] RIDGE: I actually went into the ditch and (FOGLEMAN interrupts)</p><p id = "prosecution">[57] FOGLEMAN: Was anything done to secure the scene?</p><p id = "prosecution">[58] RIDGE: Yes, we started having people, anybody that was there, of course when I got there, there was Mike Allen and Lt. Hester and Inspector Gitchell was there somewhere but I'm not exactly sure where he was. I was focusing on what was going on in the ditch and myself and Mike Allen actually went into the ditch.</p><p id = "prosecution">[59] FOGLEMAN: Okay well, what did you do to secure the scene at that point?</p><p id = "prosecution">[60] RIDGE: Uh tape, this crime scene tape was put out, a path was secured coming from outside of the woods into the crime scene so that we could come in in a unique ways in order that if there was evidence there that we had missed then we would not have destroyed that on the original paths.</p><p id = "prosecution">[61] FOGLEMAN: You made a new path?</p><p id = "prosecution">[62] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[63] FOGLEMAN: Okay, you can retake the stand officer.</p><p id = "prosecution">[64] FOGLEMAN: Alright, you mentioned that you, well first let me show you State's Exhibits 14, 15 and 16 and ask if you can identify these?</p><p id = "defense">[65] STIDHAM: Your honor may council approach the bench?</p><p id = "defense">[66] THE COURT: Sure</p><p id = "defense">[67] (Return to open court)</p><p id = "prosecution">[68] FOGLEMAN: Can you identify those?</p><p id = "prosecution">[69] RIDGE: Yes sir. These are aerial photographs of the area.</p><p id = "prosecution">[70] FOGLEMAN: Do those photographs fairly and accurately portray the scene as it appeared to you that day?</p><p id = "prosecution">[71] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[72] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Your honor we would offer State's Exhibits 14, 15 and 16.</p><p id = "prosecution">[73] THE COURT: Alright, they may be received subject to the previous ruling of the court.</p><p id = "prosecution">[74] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor may Detective RIDGE step down and exhibit these photographs to the jury and explain.</p><p id = "prosecution">[75] THE COURT: Yes he may.</p><p id = "prosecution">[76] RIDGE:( Exhibiting to jury) Ladies and gentleman this is a aerial photograph of the area known as Robin Hood Hills. This is Mayfair apartments, that would be these apartments that are here. This end of this street is west McCauley and here is the pipe that again is right here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[77] FOGLEMAN: Which exhibit number are you referring to?</p><p id = "prosecution">[78] RIDGE: This is exhibit 14. </p><p id = "prosecution">[79] FOGLEMAN: Okay</p><p id = "prosecution">[80] RIDGE: Also on this picture again here's the pipe and this is the bayou, I think it's been noted as 10 Mile Bayou. You can see the path coming through the woods. This comes into the back of the Blue Beacon which is this establishment here, and you can see the path also here in this picture. There's a path here that breaks off an comes across a hill that you can barely see in this picture also. The a bodies of the victims were found in this area in this wooded patch. This area here is the a waste water from the Blue Beacon where it has to be treated before it can be put into the sewer systems and that's also this pond as you can see here. The next picture which is Exhibit 15 is just a higher picture, this is if you're in the west looking down at the scene, Memphis would be here to the east from this area. So we're looking sort of in a southeasterly direction. These are Mayfair apartments, this is McCauley, uh, the pipe goes across right here and this is the area where the bodies were found, the Blue Beacon, 76th Truck Stop, 7th Street. Uh, 14th street would be this row houses that's behind this green, grassy area. There would be East Junior High School and Weaver Elementary. This is another higher picture. This is 7th street. 7th street runs almost due north and south in the picture, so we're looking just a little bit north and east. Memphis would be here to the right. Again here is East Junior High School, Weaver Elementary. This is 14th Street. This is Goodwin. This is west McCauley. This area here is the patch of woods known as Robin Hood Hills. This small establishment here is the Blue Beacon, the 76th Truck Stop and Mayfair apartments.</p><p id = "prosecution">[81] FOGLEMAN: Alright, you can retake the stand officer. Exhibit to the jury your honor?</p><p id = "prosecution">[82] THE COURT: Yes, you may.</p><p id = "prosecution">[83] FOGLEMAN: Now Detective RIDGE after you got there, I believe earlier you did say that you'd gotten into the water is that right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[84] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[85] FOGLEMAN: Alright after you'd got in the water what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[86] RIDGE: I got into the water north of the bodies, north of the victim that had been located, who was, we'd discovered was Michael Moore, and I proceeded to work my way through the water through the ditch, and being careful not to destroy any evidence, I was searching the bottom of the ditch as I made my way to the body. I found some clothing items (FOGLEMAN interrupts)</p><p id = "prosecution">[87] FOGLEMAN: Okay when you say you were searching the bottom of the ditch what do you mean?</p><p id = "prosecution">[88] RIDGE: Okay. Obviously you can't see into this muddy water, so, the best way to describe it is I actually do it from the water level, I was raking my hands from one bank of the water to where it came out on the other side along the bottom all the way.</p><p id = "prosecution">[89] FOGLEMAN: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[90] RIDGE: And that's what I did until I made my way to that body.</p><p id = "prosecution">[91] FOGLEMAN: Okay. And then what? After you made your way to Michael Moore what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[92] RIDGE: We took the body of Michael Moore from the water.</p><p id = "prosecution">[93] FOGLEMAN: Alright, and then what did you do?</p><p id = "prosecution">[94] RIDGE: I continued to search. We placed that body (FOGLEMAN interrupts)</p><p id = "prosecution">[95] FOGLEMAN: In the same manner?</p><p id = "prosecution">[96] RIDGE: Yes, I did. I'm the one that actually stayed in that ditch the entire time and from start to finish until all of the bodies were found, to as far as I could go in that ditch and reach the bottom that's the way I searched it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[97] FOGLEMAN: About how many feet would you say that you went in that manner?</p><p id = "prosecution">[98] RIDGE: Probably about 45 feet.</p><p id = "prosecution">[99] FOGLEMAN: Okay, and uh, in doing that did you find anything besides Michael Moore, Stevie Branch and Chris Byers?</p><p id = "prosecution">[100] RIDGE: The clothing of the victims.</p><p id = "prosecution">[101] FOGLEMAN: Were the clothing floating in the water or how did you find them?</p><p id = "prosecution">[102] RIDGE: No sir, there were, the best description is they were actually pushed into the mud in the bottom of the creek.

"prosecution">[103] FOGLEMAN: I want to show you State's Exhibit 8 and ask you if you can identify that?</p><p id = "prosecution">[104] RIDGE: This is a blue and yellow Cub Scout cap.</p><p id =

Alright, we're in the north, we're looking in a southerly direction, even a little bit to the southeast. Okay, this is the ditch where the bodies were found. Michael Moore was found in this area right here at the bottom of the screen. Steve Branch was found just behind where these trees are in this stream and Christopher Byers was found just below that body right here in that same stream.</p><p id = "prosecution">[203] FOGLEMAN: Detective RIDGE let me interrupt you just a minute, now when Michael Moore, which way was his head and which way were his feet?</p><p id = "prosecution">[204] RIDGE: Okay, Michael Moore's head was in a northerly direction and his feet were to the south in the stream.</p><p id = "prosecution">[205] FOGLEMAN: Okay, so his head would have been upstream or downstream?</p><p id = "prosecution">[206] RIDGE: Upstream</p><p id = "prosecution">[207] FOGLEMAN: Alright, and on Stevie and Chris, uh, how were they?</p><p id = "prosecution">[208] RIDGE: Their feet were northbound or upstream and their head was downstream.</p><p id = "prosecution">[209] FOGLEMAN: Okay, alright go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[210] RIDGE: Okay, uh, this mark on the tree, now when we say that's an accurate description of where I found it, this mark was put there as a marker for measurements being taken on the crime scene. Whether or not you can see it or not, there's also a mark on one of these trees which is the same thing but, the rest of the crime scene appeared to be similar to that except this black plastic was not there when we first got there. This black plastic was used to uh, cover the bodies after we removed them from the water.( Exhibiting new picture to jury) Exhibit 29 again this is the ditch where the bodies were found. We're looking again towards the south, and the body of Steve Branch was found in this area. The body of Christopher Byers was found right here and this is me here in the background, after we had removed the bodies we were searching for anything that may have been missed during the initial search going through there and we pumped all of the water out. This is a suction hose where we were pumping the water out of the stream.</p><p id = "prosecution">[211] FOGLEMAN: Alright, let me ask you a question about that one while you've got it. You say you pumped all the water out?</p><p id = "prosecution">[212] RIDGE: All that we could get out of it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[213] FOGLEMAN: Alright, and then after you pumped all of the water out what did you do in looking for evidence?</p><p id = "prosecution">[214] RIDGE: Again we visually searched for everything. We got a metal detector. We searched everything that was there trying to find anything that may have been a piece of evidence.</p><p id = "prosecution">[215] FOGLEMAN: Anything of significance found?</p><p id = "prosecution">[216] RIDGE: No, sir</p><p id = "prosecution">[217] FOGLEMAN: Alright.

I marked the picture right here.

The shelf elevation which is 210 foot, that means that approximately 5 foot below the elevation of the top bank would be this shelf area.</p><p id = "prosecution">[381] FOGLEMAN: Alright, is this the area that we talked about being slicked off?</p><p id = "prosecution">[382] RIDGE: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[383] FOGLEMAN: Okay, then go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[384] RIDGE: Okay the flow line elevation which is the actual bottom of the ditch, is 207.5 feet. Which is 7 and a half feet below the top of the bank, or of the mean elevation, 215 feet. The low bank elevation which this is basically a ditch within a ditch, this whole white area that you see would be a ditch if there was a large amount of water coming through the ditch. Under normal flow conditions this is the ditch within that ditch and that is the bank that actually goes a sharp cut down to the bottom of that ditch.</p><p id = "prosecution">[385] FOGLEMAN: Okay, you can retake the stand.</p><p id = "prosecution">[386] (RIDGE retaking the stand)</p><p id = "prosecution">[387] FOGLEMAN: Detective RIDGE when you're standing, when you were in the creek or ditch, whatever you want to call it, where Mike and Stevie and Chris were found, what can you see up on top?</p><p id = "prosecution">[388] RIDGE: You can't hardly see anything.

Now the high bank is pointing at this high bank which would be the level of the, the normal level of the ground. And it's gonna be the same on both sides, the normal level.

And then what happened?</p><p id = "prosecution">[606] RIDGE: Uh, Inspector Gitchell actually moved the picture out of his sight and we continued to talk to him. </p><p id = "prosecution">[607] FOGLEMAN: Alright.

Now, what was your purpose in leaving the room?</p><p id = "prosecution">[622] RIDGE: Okay. We had just played this tape, and Jessie says something to the effect that uh, I want out of this, I want to tell you everything, at which time we started asking him some more questions. We asked about this third telephone call, that's when that third telephone call came in, and he tells us about what Damien had said in the background. And I felt this was extremely good information and that uh, we were at the verge of getting a good witness. And I wanted, I just decided it was time to take a break and I wanted to inform Sgt. Allen of this information.</p><p id = "prosecution">[623] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Now, up to this point, um, did you have any reason to, to, to um, to suspect that the defendant was involved?</p><p id = "prosecution">[624] RIDGE: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[625] FOGLEMAN: Alright. Had y'all uh...what was the demeanor or the atmosphere when y'all were questioning him? </p><p id = "prosecution">[626] RIDGE: It was, mostly we were just as nice as we could be.

I mean, there, there wasn't anything except the incident with the picture that you could see there was stress. </p><p id = "prosecution">[629] FOGLEMAN: Okay.</p><p id = "prosecution">[630] RIDGE: The incident with the tape recorder, when he reacted like I want out of this, I want to tell you everything.</p><p id = "prosecution">[631] FOGLEMAN: Okay.

What was, what was that about?</p><p id = "prosecution">[636] RIDGE: Okay, there was a, it's an interrogation technique that Inspector Gitchell used. It's basically a circle that would be drawn on a piece of paper, there were dots all over the paper, uh, where are you in this circle. That is a question that was asked of the defendant. Are you a witness, are you a defendant, what are you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[637] FOGLEMAN: Okay. Alright, now, um. After you went out, uh, of the room, what happened next? </p><p id = "prosecution">[638] RIDGE: Okay, I was talking with Sgt.

And were these his shoes or somebody else's shoes?</p><p id = "prosecution">[644] RIDGE: He said they were his shoes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[645] FOGLEMAN: Alright.
