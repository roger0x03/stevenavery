FOGLEMAN: We call Vickie Hutcheson.</p><p id = "defense">[7] MR. CROW: Your Honor, may we approach the bench?</p><p id = "defense">[8] (THE FOLLOWING CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE JURY)</p><p id = "defense">[9] MR. CROW: I may be anticipating what they are going to try to elicit from this witness but I anticipate she's going to testify that she saw him at some alleged cult meeting after the murders. If she wants to testify that she saw him with Damien, that's fine, but all this cult stuff - - I don't think there's been a proper foundation laid for it. It is prejudicial and we would strongly object.</p><p id = "defense">[10] THE COURT: After - - is that what you're going to do - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[11] MR. FOGLEMAN: Between the murders and the arrests.</p><p id = "prosecution">[12] THE COURT: But after the event.</p><p id = "prosecution">[13] MR. FOGLEMAN: That's correct.</p><p id = "defense">[14] MR. STIDHAM: Just because he was somewhere drinking and carrying on with somebody doesn't mean he's satanic - - </p><p id = "defense">[15] THE COURT: I'm reminded of the Strobbe objection, the first trial - - it wasn't Strobbe - - it was the biscuit man - - where y'all persuaded me to let in some evidence that happened after the time of the charge that indicated either criminal activity or wrongdoing and the Court said you couldn't do that - - the Ridling trial. Is there any difference in what you're trying to do here?</p><p id = "prosecution">[16] MR. FOGLEMAN: In this particular case the defendant in his confession talked about this cult activity. We contend that the proof is going to show that within maybe a couple weeks after the murders she got Jessie to introduce her to Damien, and Damien invited her to an Esbat, some kind of witch or satan worship deal. Damien and Jessie took her there.  And while there she observed the kids. Some of them have their faces painted black, they begin to have sex. She asked to leave and Damien took her home and Jessie stayed.</p><p id = "defense">[17] MR. STIDHAM: We have already brought out in cross examination why the police were looking - - why they picked up Jessie that morning, and this is highly prejudicial in that it occurred after the murders if it occurred at all, and I think any probative value is surely outweighed by the prejudicial effect of this.</p><p id = "prosecution">[18] MR. DAVIS: Judge, one thing that you need to remember - - in their entire cross examination of the officers yesterday they kept asking, "Do you have any evidence that Jessie was involved in cult activity? What evidence do you have?"</p><p id = "defense">[19] MR. CROW: It has already been discussed.</p><p id = "prosecution">[20] MR. DAVIS: We can put on witnesses to show what evidence they have.</p><p id = "prosecution">[21] MR. FOGLEMAN: And they were the ones in their examination of the officers who asked about, "Where did you get this information about Jessie being involved in with this cult stuff with Damien?"</p><p id = "prosecution">[22] THE COURT: I'm going to take a recess and think about it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[23] (RETURN TO OPEN COURT)</p><p id = "prosecution">[24] THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, you may take a ten minute recess at this time with the usual admonition not to discuss the case.</p><p id = "prosecution">[25] (RECESS)</p><p id = "prosecution">[26] (THE FOLLOWING CONFERENCE TOOK PLACE IN CHAMBERS)</p><p id = "prosecution">[27] THE COURT: Let the record reflect that is a hearing out of the presence of the jury. All right, gentlemen, the Court is considering the testimony of Vickie Hutcheson. State for the Court what your theory and notion of relevance is to this testimony.</p><p id = "prosecution">[28] MR. FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we expect that the witness would testify that approximately two weeks after the murders - - two to three weeks after the murders - - she was introduced to the co-defendant Damien Echols by the defendant and after being introduced she kind of played detective and got Damien or led Damien to believe that she was interested in occult activity and Damien invited her to an Esbat, which I understand is some kind of witch of satanic meeting.  That Damien and the defendant took her to this meeting and that at this meeting a group of young people were there. They had their faces painted black and began to take off all their clothes and have sex with each other.  Let me back up. I don't think she's - - I think she's going to say she left before that actually took place. They began to touch each other is what I think she said. Then she asked to leave and Damien took her home and the defendant stayed.  The theory of relevance is that the defendant in his confession stated that he had been engaged in cult activities with Damien Echols, and there were orgies that took place and the defense has taken the position that we would not be able to prove any of  these cult activities or any connection with any cult, and this is offered to corroborate what the defendant said as far as his involvement in these activities which the defendant in his statement relates to the murders by his statement that there was a photograph of the little boys that was passed around at one of these meetings.</p><p id = "defense">[29] MR. CROW: Your Honor, first, the prejudicial effect of this type of testimony in front of your average American juror is obvious. Very few members of American society are anything but Judeo-Christian ethic.  This activity allegedly occurred two weeks after the murders. There's no alleged connection between this event and the murders. There's nothing been put forth so far in the prosecution's case or anything I'm aware they're going to put on saying the actual murders were cult related other than the fact that these guys may have been in a cult together.  Jessie doesn't say in his statement it was a cult killing. There's no physical evidence to my knowledge, on the scene making it cult related.  And the effect this thing is going to have on the jury is very substantial and the probative value for something that happened two weeks after the murder is  so limited.</p><p id = "defense">[30] THE COURT: I'm not going to let you do it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[31] MR. FOGLEMAN: You're preventing us from being able to corroborate the things he says in his statement and - - I am not arguing with the Court.</p><p id = "prosecution">[32] THE COURT: The last time I did it I restricted the defense and the Court reversed saying that I - - but the issue there was entrapment and it was conduct of the police that they wanted to demonstrate afterwards.</p><p id = "prosecution">[33] MR. FOGLEMAN: That's correct.</p><p id = "prosecution">[34] THE COURT: This is a little different situation, frankly. The conduct is conduct of the defendant.</p><p id = "defense">[35] MR. STIDHAM: But it's after the murders.</p><p id = "defense">[36] THE COURT: The issue is whether or not that portrayal of him involved in cult activities with the co-defendant would so prejudice the jury against him that it would outweigh any probative value, that is, the corroboration of his statement.</p><p id = "defense">[37] MR. STIDHAM: Your Honor, would you consider this? We are not here to determine whether or not Jessie was in a cult meeting in Turrell. We're here to determine whether or not he was involved in a homicide.</p><p id = "defense">[38] THE COURT: It's relevant inasmuch as you're questioning and have since the outset of the trial the statement itself made by Misskelley. You are alleging that it was contrived, that it's false and it is simply not true. So - - and basically that is the only evidence that ties Misskelley directly to the commission of a crime is his own statement. So it is extremely important and relevant that the jury be provided all evidence necessary to decide whether or not that statement was voluntarily given and whether it was truthful at the outset. So I certainly understand the State's position. I'm trying to balance the thing.</p><p id = "prosecution">[39] MR. FOGLEMAN: Your Honor if - - if you want to - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[40] THE COURT: I'm more concerned about all of the fact and details that occurred at the - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[41] MR. FOGLEMAN: Do you want us to ask her not to say about what they were doing?</p><p id = "prosecution">[42] THE COURT: What took place. I think I'm inclined to let her testify that she attended, whatever you called it, occult activity with Jessie Misskelley and Damien Echols.</p><p id = "defense">[43] MR. STIDHAM: That's the prejudicial part that we are objecting to.</p><p id = "defense">[44] THE COURT: You're not objecting to black painted faces and sex?</p><p id = "defense">[45] MR. CROW: We're objecting to that, too.</p><p id = "defense">[46] THE COURT: I think it is relevant, and they're entitled to show that it's true that there were cult activities, based upon at least this witness' representation.  But I'm more concerned about all the details and circumstances that the witness would be prepared to testify to. Those to me are more prejudicial than the fact that he went to a cult activity. </p><p id = "defense">[47] MR. STIDHAM: Your Honor, the State is required to corroborate the homicides, not corroborate that maybe he was at a meeting - - </p><p id = "defense">[48] MR. CROW: - - two weeks after the murder.</p><p id = "defense">[49] MR. STIDHAM: - - with teenagers drinking and having an orgy - - </p><p id = "defense">[50] MR. CROW: - - two weeks after the murder.</p><p id = "defense">[51] MR. STIDHAM: He's here on a homicide. That is why we are here before the Court is to determine if he was involved in a homicide.</p><p id = "defense">[52] MR. CROW: If they want to prove that he was at some cult activity prior to the homicides as he says he said in his statement, that's one thing. But proving he was at cult activity after the homicide - - something he didn't discuss in his statement - - is totally out of bounds.</p><p id = "prosecution">[53] MR. FOGLEMAN: If we were talking about three months after, I could see the point about - - but we are only talking about a few weeks. And, really if y'all were not arguing false confession, we wouldn't be in a position like we are because all we would have to do is corroborate that the crime occurred. But with you arguing false confession, we feel compelled to try to corroborate as many details as we can.  In fact I think your expert says that some of the things that are important is whether or not you are able to corroborate details unrelated that he says in his statement.</p><p id = "defense">[54] MR. CROW: Corroborating with stuff - - his activity prior to the crime, which is things he talked about, is one thing. Maybe he said he was a St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan and saying he went to a St. Louis Cardinals game after the crime - - I just don't see the - - obviously that is not prejudicial.</p><p id = "defense">[55] MR. STIDHAM: That's why they are wanting to hang this boy and that is why the newspapers have been splashing this cult stuff and that's why everybody's got their mind made up about his guilt or innocence because they are so petrified and horrified by this cult stuff. Mr. Crow made a good point that people - - </p><p id = "defense">[56] THE COURT: Everything they've just said are certainly subject matters of cross examination if he takes the stand. There's no question about that.  I'm going to let them develop from the witness that she went with Jessie and Damien to a cult activity and that - - to that extent, basically. Don't go into all the circumstances of what was seen and what was done and that sort of thing.  I think the fact that you are challenging both the police activity - - overreaching of the defendant in taking a confession - - the fact that the confession is false, that is a fabrication on the part of Jessie Misskelley, that the State should be given some latitude to prove that this is not false. These are the underlying facts that support the truthfulness of the statement. I think just basic fairness allows him to do that.  On the other hand, I'm trying to balance the harmful effect by - - I agree to some extent if they went in there and started telling about black painted faces and children having sex in the woods with devil signs around and all of those sorts of things, that would be prejudicial to some extent. But whether or not that prejudice would outweigh its probative value, I'm not certain.  I frankly think that maybe fairness would allow it to all go in to show the circumstances immediately after the crime. But I'm going to limit it to the fact that she did attend with them some kind of cult activity without allowing her to go into all the details.</p><p id = "defense">[57] MR.
