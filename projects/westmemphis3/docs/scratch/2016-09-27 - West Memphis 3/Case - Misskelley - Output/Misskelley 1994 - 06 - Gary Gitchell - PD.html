I've been informed that one of the papers carried a photograph of a witness who had requested not to be photographed or depicted on live coverage that also included the jury. I'm considering a rather substantial fine. I'm asking that you not to do that again. The jury is not to be photographed under any circumstances, and I sure don't like it placed in the (p. 942) newspaper, if it was, and that is what was reported to me. I want you to avoid that or I will consider a fine.</p><p>[3] All right, you may proceed.</p><p>[4] CROSS EXAMINATION</p><p id = "defense">[5] BY MR. STIDHAM:</p><p id = "defense">[6] Q: Good morning.</p><p id = "defense">[7] A: Good morning.</p><p id = "defense">[8] Q: Inspector Gitchell, we heard the tape yesterday of Jessie's statement. Did you and Detective Ridge rehearse Jessie's story before you turned the tape recorder on?</p><p id = "defense">[9] A: No, we did not.</p><p id = "defense">[10] Q: So basically this was a contemporaneous thing after you showed the photograph and diagram and played the tape?</p><p id = "defense">[11] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[12] Q: How did Ridge know what to say and what to ask?</p><p id = "defense">[13] A: I don't understand what you mean.</p><p id = "defense">[14] Q: A lot of the questions, a lot of what Jessie was saying was merely repeating what Ridge said to him.</p><p id = "defense">[15] A: I believe there was a lot of repetition on Mr. Ridge's part of what Jessie said.</p><p id = "defense">[16] Q: Let's talk about the things that Jessie told you that are absolutely incorrect beginning with Jessie's statement that Jason Baldwin called him at 9:00 in the morning. Isn't it true that Jason Baldwin - - </p><p id = "defense">[17] (p. 943)</p><p id = "prosecution">[18] MR. Fogleman: What page are you on?</p><p id = "defense">[19] MR. STIDHAM: I believe it is in the very beginning.</p><p id = "defense">[20] BY THE WITNESS:</p><p id = "defense">[21] A: I'm sorry. You're going to have to repeat that for me.</p><p id = "defense">[22] Q: Mr. Misskelley said he had received a phone call from Jason Baldwin at 9:00 A.M.?</p><p id = "defense">[23] A: I don't - - is that in there? Could you show that to me? </p><p id = "defense">[24] Q: I stand corrected. That was something that Jessie told Detective Ridge prior to the tape recorder being turned on. Do you recall being there and being present when he said that?</p><p id = "defense">[25] A: Who said it? I've lost track now.</p><p id = "defense">[26] Q: Jessie said he received a phone call from Jason Baldwin at nine in the morning.</p><p id = "defense">[27] A: I believe that's nine at night.</p><p id = "defense">[28] Q: I'm going to skip over that and we'll come back to that. I'll find my notes, and we will clarify that. </p><p id = "defense">[29] Another thing that Jessie told you, I believe this is on the tape, is that Jessie was standing on the service road when he saw Damien hit Christopher Byers. How far is the service road from - -</p><p id = "defense">[30] A: No, sir. There's never anything mentioned of the service road.</p><p id = "defense">[31] Q: There's not?</p><p id = "defense">[32] (p. 944)</p><p id = "defense">[33] A: I don't recall anything.</p><p id = "prosecution">[34] MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, it is improper cross examination for him to ask general questions. If he wants to refer to the tape recorded statement or to previous statements and say in fact this is what was said, is that what took place, and why was that said, that's one thing. But he's generalizing - - and it's the State's position he's incorrectly generalizing what is contained in the statement.</p><p id = "prosecution">[35] THE COURT: Approach the bench.</p><p id = "prosecution">[36] (THE FOLLOWING CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE JURY)</p><p id = "prosecution">[37] THE COURT: I'm having a problem with the way that you are proceeding on cross examining him on a statement made by Misskelley.</p><p id = "defense">[38] MR. STIDHAM: He was present in the room when the questioning - -</p><p id = "defense">[39] THE COURT: I'm going to let you do it if you take the statement and refer to it page by page and line by line and ask, "Was this statement made?"</p><p id = "defense">[40] MR. STIDHAM: Judge, I've been over that statement so many times. I know what's in there. I don't have the page numbers - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[41] MR. Fogleman: Your Honor, I think I know what's in there, too, and I don't remember anything referring (p. 945) to a service road and watching him hit - - </p><p id = "defense">[42] MR. STIDHAM: Your Honor, I'm going to have to have ten minutes or so to go through it and put the page numbers down.</p><p id = "defense">[43] THE COURT: All right. Can you ask other questions now that gets rid of the rest of your cross examination?</p><p id = "defense">[44] MR. STIDHAM: That is what my cross examination mostly consists of, your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[45] (RETURN TO OPEN COURT)</p><p id = "defense">[46] THE COURT: We're going to take a ten minute recess at this time with the usual admonition not to discuss the case.</p><p id = "defense">[47] (RECESS)</p><p id = "defense">[48] CROSS EXAMINATION</p><p id = "defense">[49] BY MR. STIDHAM:</p><p id = "defense">[50] Q: We are going to try this again. If I confuse you about page numbers, just say so and we'll compare.</p><p id = "defense">[51] A: Okay.</p><p id = "defense">[52] Q: As you know, there's two different transcripts. The transcript I've been looking at is a little bit different than the one that was shown to the jury yesterday. If there's any confusion on your part, please let me know, and we'll clarify it.</p><p id = "defense">[53] On page three of his statement Jessie tells you that him (p. 946) and Jason and Damien went down to the woods, that they left to go down there about nine o'clock. Did you find that part yet?</p><p id = "defense">[54] A: I see where - - nine o'clock in the morning. Is that what you're in reference to?</p><p id = "defense">[55] Q: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[56] A: Okay. I see that.</p><p id = "defense">[57] Q: You confirmed that Jason Baldwin went to school that day, did you not?</p><p id = "defense">[58] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[59] Q: What time does school normally begin in West Memphis?</p><p id = "defense">[60] A: Jason I think goes to Marion. I'm not sure what time it starts.</p><p id = "defense">[61] Q: Inspector Gitchell, how far is it from the place where the bodies were found to the interstate and service road?</p><p id = "defense">[62] A: I couldn't give you an exact. It would be just a guesstimate on my part - - 60, 70 yards - - something like that. I'm assuming. I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[63] Q: On page nine of his statement, Inspector Gitchell, Jessie says the murders took place around noon, and when he told you that, you knew at that time that that wasn't correct, did you not?</p><p id = "defense">[64] A: That's right.</p><p id = "defense">[65] Q: How did you know that was incorrect?</p><p id = "defense">[66] A: Because the boys - - the young boys were still in school.</p><p id = "defense">[67] Q: Later on, on that same page he makes reference to the (p. 947) little boys had skipped school that day.</p><p id = "defense">[68] A: Yes, sir, he did. But I believe Jessie is getting confused there. Jason Baldwin was supposed to skip school that day, and they were all going to - -</p><p id = "defense">[69] Q: The little boys didn't skip school that day, did they, Inspector Gitchell?</p><p id = "defense">[70] A: The little boys did not skip school, but Jason was to skip school that day.</p><p id = "defense">[71] Q: That's not what I asked you. My question was, did the little boys skip school that day?</p><p id = "defense">[72] A: No, the little boys did not.</p><p id = "defense">[73] Q: You knew that was incorrect when Jessie told you that?</p><p id = "defense">[74] A: That's correct.</p><p id = "defense">[75] Q: Thank you. How were the boys tied when the bodies were discovered?</p><p id = "defense">[76] A: They were tied by shoestring from wrist, like right wrist to the right ankle.</p><p id = "defense">[77] Q: In Jessie's second statement that was played to the jury yesterday did he tell you they were tied with a brown rope?</p><p id = "defense">[78] A: That's correct.</p><p id = "defense">[79] Q: These seem to be pretty important issues with regard to his statement. At anytime when he was telling you these things that you knew were incorrect, did it ever occur to you that what he was telling you was false and his entire story was false?</p><p id = "defense">[80] A: There's always a time in a defendant's statement - - that in (p. 948) Jessie's case I feel like he did tell us a good bit of truth, but then they also lessen their activity in a statement. That's just common, at least in my twenty years career.</p><p id = "defense">[81] Q: Is it common to ignore things like time of death and the fact that the boys were not tied up - - </p><p id = "defense">[82] A: Well - - </p><p id = "defense">[83] Q: Let me finish my question, Inspector.</p><p id = "defense">[84] A: I was going to answer the first part.</p><p id = "defense">[85] Q: Is it common for the police to simply ignore those big obvious problems and assume that everything else he's telling you has gotta be correct?</p><p id = "defense">[86] A: It is easy to ignore the part about the boys skipping school because you simply know that's not true. Jessie simply got confused. That's all.</p><p id = "defense">[87] Q: Confused. Now, the prosecuting attorney was obviously concerned about some of the things Jessie was getting wrong, wasn't he?</p><p id = "defense">[88] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[89] Q: That was the purpose for the second statement?</p><p id = "defense">[90] A: Yes, sir, right.</p><p id = "defense">[91] Q: Why didn't you go into these issues with him when you had him on the tape recorder the first time?</p><p id = "defense">[92] A: I have a tendency if someone is in a portion of an interview that they are talking that - - if you will notice through the transcript I said very little. And that is my (p. 949) technique, is to let someone go ahead and talk.</p><p id = "defense">[93] So I simply allowed him to keep talking and I injected very little into the interview.</p><p id = "defense">[94] Q: But the prosecutor later told you he had some serious questions about this and asked you to go back in and talk to Jessie again?</p><p id = "defense">[95] A: Right.</p><p id = "defense">[96] Q: Inspector Gitchell, was it a big secret about what had happened to these little boys and what injuries they sustained?</p><p id = "defense">[97] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[98] Q: I guess you were shocked when some of the people you were bringing in off the street and questioning - - they told you what had happened to the little boys?</p><p id = "defense">[99] A: You have lost me on that. You'd have to get me some names that I can refer to so I can get some files and see.</p><p id = "defense">[100] Q: (HANDING) Do you remember the police interviewing a fellow by the name of Richard Cummings on 5-12-93?</p><p id = "defense">[101] A: This is Lieutenant Sudbury's notes. Are you mentioning this, "pointed to the penis and said it was cut off"?</p><p id = "defense">[102] Q: And that the little boys were beat up.</p><p id = "defense">[103] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[104] Q: It is obvious that Mr. Cummings knew what had happened?</p><p id = "defense">[105] A: I believe that - - it was ran in the news media that all had been sexually mutilated. If my recollection is correct, which in fact was not true.</p><p id = "defense">[106] (p. 950)</p><p id = "defense">[107] Q: We're going to talk about that in a minute.</p><p id = "defense">[108] MR. STIDHAM: Do you have any problem with this?</p><p id = "prosecution">[109] MR. Fogleman: Your Honor, we don't have any objection to introducing the exhibit, but it's just a series of what are answers to questions that were put to people, and I think the questionnaire ought to be attached, too.</p><p id = "defense">[110] MR. STIDHAM: Judge, the obvious question is what happened to these little boys and this is what he told them.</p><p id = "defense">[111] THE COURT: Well - - </p><p id = "defense">[112] MR. STIDHAM: I don't have any problem with attaching the questionnaire as a part of the exhibit.</p><p id = "defense">[113] THE COURT: Let me see what you're doing.</p><p id = "defense">[114] MR. STIDHAM: Your Honor, the purpose of the exhibit is to demonstrate to the jury that this information about what had happened to the little boys wasn't a top secret situation. Everybody in West Memphis knew about it and heard rumors about it.</p><p id = "defense">[115] THE COURT: Are you objecting?</p><p id = "defense">[116] MR. STIDHAM: No, they said they had an objection, your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[117] THE COURT: Well, I didn't follow. There was some objection - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[118] MR. Fogleman: Your Honor, the only thing we said (p. 951) is if that is going to be admitted, it is hearsay because Detective Gitchell did not do it but if it's going to be admitted, we think the questionnaire ought to be attached as well.</p><p id = "prosecution">[119] THE COURT: Approach the bench.</p><p id = "prosecution">[120] (THE FOLLOWING CONFERENCE WAS HELD AT THE BENCH OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE JURY)</p><p id = "prosecution">[121] THE COURT: Are you objecting to the admission of this? It is hearsay and police reports are not admissible.</p><p id = "defense">[122] MR. STIDHAM: They have already said they have no objection.</p><p id = "defense">[123] THE COURT: It was kind of equivocal "If it is going to be admitted." I don't know if that's objecting to it or not. That's what I'm asking.</p><p id = "defense">[124] MR. STIDHAM: I understood they had no objection.</p><p id = "defense">[125] THE COURT: If they don't, go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[126] MR. DAVIS: We don't have an objection if the questionnaire is attached to it. But if we end up with - - </p><p id = "prosecution">[127] THE COURT: Are we going to go through a whole series of interviews of people?</p><p id = "defense">[128] MR.
