It was a lady and her daughter and they had ordered some food and being it thirty minutes before closing, I told them that it would take a few moments to get their order prepared. The lady went--said that she would be right back, she was going to take her daughter to the restroom and she came back within a minute around the corner. I thought something was wrong so I asked her and at that time, she said there was a black gentleman in the women's restroom and I thought that was kind of strange so I said "well, I'll go check on it" and he was there, in the restroom, with his head in his lap. </p><p id = "defense">[35] Q: Describe what you seen when you entered the women's restroom.</p><p id = "defense">[36] A: Well, above the commode, on the wall, there was a forearm print--imprint of blood along with blood that was around the toilet where the gentleman was sitting.</p><p id = "defense">[37] Q: Did you see anything else in the--besides blood?</p><p id = "defense">[38] A: Well, I spoke to the gentleman and he raised his head and was kind of disarrayed. He also had a--muddy feet, wet up to his knees and he spoke but I--I just was checking to see if he was all right and asking him to leave the building</p><p id = "defense">[39] Q: Did he comply with your request?</p><p id = "defense">[40] A: Well, he said that he was all right but he did not get up. </p><p id = "defense">[41] Q: Okay. Did he, subsequently, leave?</p><p id = "defense">[42] A: He left, approximately, fifteen to twenty minutes later.</p><p id = "defense">[43] Q: What did you do after you asked him to leave?</p><p id = "defense">[44] A: I went and called the police department to maybe have this gentleman checked out and ask him to leave with--you know with an officer there, someone would leave more freely than just someone asking him to. </p><p id = "defense">[45] Q: Did the West Memphis Police Department respond to your call?</p><p id = "defense">[46] A: Yes, they did. The officer never got out of the car, just came around to the drive-thru window and asked me what the problem was and, at this time, the gentleman had already left and was walking.</p><p id = "defense">[47] Q: Okay. Did the officer ever come in the building?</p><p id = "defense">[48] A: No, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[49] Q: What did you do with the mess?</p><p id = "defense">[50] A: Well, we couldn't leave it so we had to clean it up. We drug a water hose around, that's as big of a mess as it was in the floor and proceeded to wash and clean up the restroom. </p><p id = "defense">[51] Q: Did-did you find anything in the restroom that this gentleman left behind?</p><p id = "defense">[52] A: Well, in the toilet, he had tried to pl--flush a pair of sunglasses down the...</p><p id = "prosecution">[53] FOGLEMAN: [interrupting] Your Honor, unless he knows that he actually tried to flush the sunglasses, now, it's one thing if the sunglasses were just there, unless he actually knows that he tried to flush it </p><p id = "prosecution">[54] THE COURT: Where did you find the sunglasses?</p><p id = "prosecution">[55] KING: They were in the toilet.</p><p id = "prosecution">[56] THE COURT: All right.</p><p id = "defense">[57] By STIDHAM</p><p id = "defense">[58] Q: Do you have reason to believe that they belonged to this gentleman?</p><p id = "defense">[59] A: Well, they were not in the restroom before he entered and with the bowel movement that he had all over him, the seat, the floor and everywhere, there was nothing in the toilet except the glasses when I went in there to clean up the mess so it leads me to believe that he tried flushing it. </p><p id = "defense">[60] Q: Was there anything else that-that he got blood all over besides the wall and the stall?</p><p id = "defense">[61] A: Well, he had some blood on a toilet tissue roll where he had tried grabbing for it and it was discarded in the wastecan.</p><p id = "defense">[62] Q: Okay. Did you make an attempt to try to preserve the roll of toilet paper for the police?</p><p id = "defense">[63] A: No, sir. I did not.</p><p id = "defense">[64] Q: Okay. Did you ever here from the police again?</p><p id = "defense">[65] A: After that night? No, sir. Now, an off-duty police officer came into the restaurant the next morning and--that I'm aquainted with and was getting breakfast and I told him about it and we looked at it and he said "Well, just leave it alone" and he left, that he was gonna go to tell somebody about it.</p><p id = "defense">[66] Q: Did anybody else show up from the West Memphis Police department to investigate this?</p><p id = "defense">[67] A: Yes, sir. Later afternoon--well, that night.</p><p id = "defense">[68] Q: Now, was this on May the 6th, the day the bodies were discovered?</p><p id = "defense">[69] A: Mm-hm. It was around dark because one of the gentlemen was using a flashlight to look around the outside of the building.</p><p id = "defense">[70] Q: Did any of the officers come in and inspect the--any of the blood or anything?</p><p id = "defense">[71] A: Yes, sir. They took some samples and scraped them off the door and off the wall in the hallway. Now, what they did with it from there, I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[72] Q: What happened to the sunglasses and the roll of toilet paper?</p><p id = "defense">[73] A: The toilet tissue was, like I said, put in the wastepaper basket, it wasn't used but the sunglasses were taken by the officers.</p><p id = "defense">[74] Q: Did you tell the officers about the toilet paper roll?</p><p id = "defense">[75] A: Yes, sir.</p><p id = "defense">[76] STIDHAM: May I have a moment, your Honor?</p><p id = "defense">[77] THE COURT: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[78] STIDHAM: Pass the witness.</p><p id = "defense">[79] CROSS EXAMINATION</p><p id = "prosecution">[80] By FOGLEMAN</p><p id = "prosecution">[81] Q: Mr. King, now I believe that you said that the first information that you had that this person was present was somebody came and told you this person was in the women's restroom, is that right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[82] A: Yes, sir--yes, sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[83] Q: All right.
