We have watched the entire six hours of videotape, and we don't see any of that on any of those videotapes. And number 1, we don't know the relevance. We don't know of any relevance to this. He did not make any admissions in this statement to the police, and we submit it's irrelevant.</p><p id = "prosecution">[16] THE COURT: Well, I don't know how to deal with it. I mean, I read the synopsis of the report as well, and I came to the same conclusion that you did, that there really wasn't any relevant information to be gained by it and it did not amount to a confession of any crime or even come close to it. But I mean, what do you want me to tell them, they can't call him? I don't know what use they are going to make out of him as a witness.</p><p id = "prosecution">[17] DAVIS: Judge, I think we may need to have an in-camera hearing because, number 1, he may claim the Fifth Amendment. If he does, that is improper to do that in front of the jury.</p><p id = "prosecution">[18] THE COURT: Do you anticipate him taking the Fifth?</p><p id = "defense">[19] DAVIDSON: I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[20] FORD: I would think, yeah, I don't know.</p><p id = "defense">[21] (mumbling)</p><p id = "prosecution">[22] DAVIS: But Judge, the thing that bugs me is John and I spent 6 hours or whatev...well, going through 8 hours worth of videotapes, 2 days and there ain't nothing in there that resembles any admissible evidence and they never bothered to do it, we offered to give them all the tapes and before he gets up here and they create a smoke screen that has no relevance, I think the jury needs to step out and let us find out what the proffered testimony is or if he's going to take the Fifth or what's going to happen. </p><p id = "defense">[23] DAVIDSON: We tried to proffer it the other day. We said that we want to play the 6 hour confession, or the 6 hour tapes. Your Honor said no.</p><p id = "defense">[24] FORD: I think they ought to be able to go into it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[25] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, we could, they could talk to just anybody off the street and say well, you know, do you admit to doing it.</p><p id = "defense">[26] DAVIDSON: There wasn't anybody off the street that we picked up and questioned. It was the police department's questioning and the report that contained certain things.</p><p id = "defense">[27] THE COURT: Oh yeah, I'm going to start the hearing then if it gets to be --</p><p id = "prosecution">[28] FOGLEMAN: (interrupting) Your Honor, what if he takes the Fifth.

I don't know, so we're going to conduct a denno hearing.</p><p id = "defense">[36] FORD: They're objecting on the basis of relevancy, don't they carry the burden as to establishing that it is non-admissible testimony?</p><p id = "prosecution">[37] FOGLEMAN : (interrupting) Your Honor, I would also like to state that, that they mentioned before that he had some attorney representing him, that attorney represents him in some collateral matter, not in this matter, and that attorney informed me, I don't know whether he intends to do this, but she informed me that she has suggested to him that he have an attorney before he testify. Now whether he chooses to do that or not doesn't make any difference to me, but I think that's a preliminary question that needs to be addressed.</p><p id = "prosecution">[38] THE COURT: Alright. Let the record reflect this is a hearing out of the presence of the jury.

I read the material that they have as well, and I know what you're referring to but I, there's absolutely no point in asking the witness this at this time.</p><p id = "prosecution">[587] WADLEY: The relevance to it, Judge, is he stated what he did to the 3 little boys when he said that, and he was asked whether at first he was homosexual and he denied it, he later admitted it. </p><p id = "prosecution">[588] FOGLEMAN: No, he did, never did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[589] THE COURT: No, he did not.</p><p id = "prosecution">[590] Unknown: (inaudible) didn't listen to the tapes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[591] WADLEY: You don't have all the tapes evidently.</p><p id = "prosecution">[592] FOGLEMAN: I believe so.</p><p id = "prosecution">[593] WADLEY: You don't have all the tapes.</p><p id = "defense">[594] FORD: Rob, Rob -- I think we've established that the relevance, they want to rehabilitate him, that goes to weight but not to admissibility.</p><p id = "defense">[595] WADLEY: Your Honor, now that question that I asked is proper and that answer should not be stricken.</p><p id = "defense">[596] THE COURT: Do you have anything else you want to ask him?</p><p id = "defense">[597] WADLEY: No, your Honor.</p><p id = "defense">[598] DAVIDSON: I've got a couple of questions, your Honor.

Any other questions you want to ask him?</p><p id = "prosecution">[640] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, as part of the proffer, didn't you also tell the officers that you understood the little boys had their arms cut off?</p><p id = "prosecution">[641] MORGAN: From rumors, yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[642] THE COURT: Did you have anything at all to do with the murders of those 3 boys?</p><p id = "prosecution">[643] MORGAN: No, I did not.</p><p id = "prosecution">[644] THE COURT: Before you made the statements that are attributable to you, uh, did you preceed that by telling the officers in an angry state that 'if you want me to lie to ya,' and repeat yourself three or four times, 'I'll lie to ya and tell ya that I did it,' is that what you said?</p><p id = "prosecution">[645] MORGAN: Yes I did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[646] THE COURT: And immediately after that, did you again deny any knowledge or any activity involved in those murders?</p><p id = "prosecution">[647] MORGAN: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[648] THE COURT: Anything else?</p><p id = "prosecution">[649] WADLEY: Judge, I would like to, if I could, I would like to continue my proffer on the questions that I was asking him in that uh, about, concerning the sodomy this man said he performed, and could have performed on these boys, in that Judge, it is relevant in that...they attempted to elicit testimony from the medical examiner that that was possible. He says that he may have done it, and then he says that he may have blacked out, and that the question of his sexual preference is certainly relevant, your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[650] DAVIS: Your Honor, that's what it all boils down to, when he says, he tells the officers 'If you want me to lie to ya, I'll lie to ya. I'll lie to ya if that's what you want me to do. I'll lie to ya and tell you I blacked out and did it,' if he prefaces it and says 'What I'm getting ready to tell you is not true' then he later says that what he said was not true, then the fact that you say it uh, has no significance or relevance for this trial, and then to go into an area like that, to accuse him of a, to go into an area of determining whether, what motives for those statements is just ludicrous.</p><p id = "prosecution">[651] WADLEY: They have been trying to prove motive this entire trial. Your Honor, that goes to weight.</p><p id = "defense">[652] FORD: Your Honor, Jessie Misskelley denied that he did it, denied that he did it, admitted that he did it, denied it, denied it, and he is in prison. </p><p id = "prosecution">[653] DAVIS: No.</p><p id = "defense">[654] FORD: This man did the same thing.

And this testimony is relevant. </p><p id = "defense">[655] THE COURT: Relevant to what?</p><p id = "defense">[656] FORD: It is relevant to who committed these murders and that young man said he did it.

And under these circumstances, they keep talking about the statement, but that's the context in which it was made in. And the context</p><p id = "prosecution">[666] indicates that it has no reliability or relevance to this case and they just wanna throw it in a hopper to create a smoke screen or create some stir. This is, there is absolutely no relevance for somebody to say 'I'm gonna lie' and then make a statement, that statement should not be admissible because it's not reliable because they said in the first place they weren't telling the truth.</p><p id = "prosecution">[667] PRICE: We are entitled to raise reasonable doubt and that's what we're trying to do with this testimony.</p><p id = "prosecution">[668] THE COURT: Raise it or create it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[669] PRICE: Both. </p><p id = "defense">[670] FORD: Your Honor, we ask that we be allowed to ask these witness these questions and we would ask that you would rule on whether or not, the State's objecting on basis of relevance, and we ask for your ruling as to whether or not this is relevant testimony.</p><p id = "defense">[671] THE COURT: What?

We can ask him questions and if he says, based on his answers here, we can ask him did you tell the police, did you black out, did you freak out, did you kill these boys, did you fuck them up the ass. That's what he said, he said that he said those things, we want to ask him that question, we believe that's relevant.
