So we went and uh - we went and got Brian Weatherspoon, who works for the city to run up a computer check on vacant houses and we went by and picked one of those up.</p><p id = "defense">[227] FORD: Alright. About what time was that?</p><p id = "defense">[228] ALLEN: I have no earthly idea, I know I was in that area searching and riding - it probably was, I don't know - 10 - hell, I'd just be guessing. </p><p id = "defense">[229] FORD: Ok.

This is 7th street here, correct?</p><p id = "defense">[234] ALLEN: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[235] FORD: Ok. And is this the area that you were checking vacant houses on?</p><p id = "defense">[236] ALLEN: No sir. </p><p id = "defense">[237] FORD: Ok, I thought that's - tell me where you were in - was it in the residence -</p><p id = "defense">[238] ALLEN: It was - I was in the residential area which is considered the northwest, I mean, the northeast part of West Memphis, which is basically uh - the area, the residential area east of 7th street, south of the interstate, north of Broadway which crosses east and west through West Memphis and from about Club road back west. This - it's a section there of residence and all three of the boys lived within that area. </p><p id = "defense">[239] FORD: Ok. What is this street right here?</p><p id = "defense">[240] ALLEN: Um - if I could get down here.</p><p id = "defense">[241] FORD: Yes, fine, go ahead.</p><p id = "defense">[242] ALLEN: (mumbling) This right here is a mini storage, this would be corner grocery, this would be East Barton here.</p><p id = "defense">[243] FORD: That's East Barton.</p><p id = "defense">[244] ALLEN: And on down East Barton this way uh - at 14th and Barton is where they - the Byers lived on the northeast corner and the Moores lived on the northwest corner of this street right here on down. This is the residential neighborhood that we were searching. From here, backwards.</p><p id = "defense">[245] FORD: Ok. So these young boys uh - Michael, Chris, and Stevie, they don't live in any of these homes that are on this -</p><p id = "defense">[246] ALLEN: No sir, they were supposedly last seen in that area of Robinhood, was all we had. </p><p id = "defense">[247] FORD: Ok. Now this - this area here, where all these little trails are, is this known - that's considered Robinhood?</p><p id = "defense">[248] ALLEN: I don't know -</p><p id = "defense">[249] FORD: Right here. </p><p id = "defense">[250] ALLEN: Uh -</p><p id = "defense">[251] FORD: Or is it only this section here?</p><p id = "defense">[252] ALLEN: I think - I don't know exactly what - I know that they call that Robinhood Hills because that's got some sloping hills and the other area has got some - I don't know. It's something - it's not anything, I don't think, that the city named. It was - I don't know, if the residents maybe have named that uh - and it's just a name that carried on. I - I didn't grow up in that area and I don't really know what they uh - call that particular area over there with the trails.</p><p id = "defense">[253] FORD: Ok. </p><p id = "defense">[254] ALLEN: Maybe they call it all Robinhood.</p><p id = "defense">[255] FORD: This is McAuley -</p><p id = "defense">[256] ALLEN: That's West McAuley there in front of - that runs in front of Mayfair Apartments, which runs uh - it runs north and south.</p><p id = "defense">[257] FORD: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[258] ALLEN: And it dead ends into -</p><p id = "defense">[259] FORD: This is -</p><p id = "defense">[260] ALLEN: Mayfair Apartments.</p><p id = "defense">[261] FORD: Mayfair Apartments.

That's right? Is that right?</p><p id = "defense">[269] ALLEN: I don't see an aerial indicator on north, but it's basically - yes.</p><p id = "defense">[270] FORD: Ok.

But that is it as far as -</p><p id = "defense">[277] ALLEN: Yes sir.</p><p id = "defense">[278] FORD: Now, around 10:00, you and Detective Hester were checking empty houses. Or at least that's what time you picked up this computer printout, is that right?</p><p id = "defense">[279] ALLEN: I - like I said, I'm not sure what time it was. Sometime between 8:00 that morning and when I found the boys. I was in that area checking vacant houses and -</p><p id = "defense">[280] FORD: At what point did you, if you can Sergeant, tell me when you went from checking the vacant houses to going in these woods? What caused you to change your described duties?</p><p id = "defense">[281] ALLEN: There was a call that came out over the radio that was directed to 249, which is George Phillips a officer with the West Memphis Police Department - a uniformed officer, um - I don't really remember anything other than they wanted George Phillips uh - dispatch called and asked that George Phillips meet a county officer at the dead end of West McAuley, which is the area uh - which is - which is this area -</p><p id = "defense">[282] FORD: Mark where McAuley street is. Alright. Would you put your initials there, M.A., Mike Allen.

Uh - I met him as I was going into the woods. Uh - Steve Jones who is a juvenile officer was at the location that uh - had observed the shoe and I guess him and Denver were in that area at that time searching.</p><p id = "defense">[286] FORD: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[287] ALLEN: Uh - </p><p id = "defense">[288] FORD: So there's George Phillips -</p><p id = "defense">[289] ALLEN: George Phillips -</p><p id = "defense">[290] FORD: - Steve Jones, and Denver Reed and yourself - those four individuals?</p><p id = "defense">[291] ALLEN: I think Denver had - was leaving out as we were - we were coming in. Uh - as I recall, when I found the first body, uh -</p><p id = "defense">[292] FORD: Who was there with you?</p><p id = "defense">[293] ALLEN: Uh - Diane Hester had came in about that time, George Phillips was still there, and Steve Jones was there. Now, when I found the first body, Steve Jones left in a rather hurry fashion - sick. </p><p id = "defense">[294] FORD: Ok.</p><p id = "defense">[295] ALLEN: Uh - George Phillips, which is a uniformed officer, uh - got back, I know that. He was - they were up on the hillside and he got back, I mean uh - </p><p id = "defense">[296] FORD: And what about Detective Hester?</p><p id = "defense">[297] ALLEN: Now, Detective Hester uh - got on the radio and contacted Inspector Gitchell at that time.</p><p id = "defense">[298] FORD: Did she have a portable radio with her?</p><p id = "defense">[299] ALLEN: Yes.</p><p id = "defense">[300] FORD: Ok. So when you walked into the woods and you were walking across this bank, you're out there with Detective Hester, Patrolman Phillips, and Steve Jones, and yourself. Anyone else?</p><p id = "defense">[301] ALLEN: Uh - Diane came in - probably walked in behind me.</p><p id = "defense">[302] FORD: Ok. But was she there when you were trying to cross the ditch?</p><p id = "defense">[303] ALLEN: Yes, she's the one that took that photograph I believe. I don't - I would assume she did.

I -</p><p id = "defense">[306] FORD: You don't know who took that picture?</p><p id = "defense">[307] ALLEN: Well, I'm not in a position to really tell, but I think it was Diane Hester.</p><p id = "defense">[308] FORD: Ok. Well, who - who had the camera out there between the four of you?</p><p id = "defense">[309] ALLEN: (sigh) Must have been Diane Hester. Diane Hester, I would think. I wouldn't think George -</p><p id = "defense">[310] FORD: Diane Hester. And did Diane take that picture, which is state's exhibit number 11?</p><p id = "defense">[311] ALLEN: I would assume she did.</p><p id = "defense">[312] FORD: Ok. And state's exhibit number 31, who took that photograph?</p><p id = "defense">[313] ALLEN: That, I don't know uh - I don't - around this time period, when she got on the radio - I don't know, this would have been after I had already discovered the body and I was pointing downward uh - and at this time, I had rubber gloves on, so this picture would have been taken - I would imagine Inspector Gitchell would have arrived at that time uh - the camera bag was - another camera bag from the police department was brought in that time, that's what's beside me right there, so I don't know who took this photograph. This was taken from up on a - up on a bank and they were - a couple of officers up there, I don't know who was taking the photograph.</p><p id = "defense">[314] THE COURT: You need 'em?</p><p id = "defense">[315] FORD: Yes sir, I'm not done with 'em.

A black face?</p><p id = "defense">[322] ALLEN: Yes, it's the same watch I've got on right here.</p><p id = "defense">[323] FORD: And what color is the watch face you have now?</p><p id = "defense">[324] ALLEN: It's black, it's the same color.</p><p id = "defense">[325] FORD: Show you state's exhibit number 10, what color is the face on that watch?</p><p id = "defense">[326] ALLEN: This is -</p><p id = "defense">[327] FORD: It's white, isn't it?</p><p id = "defense">[328] ALLEN: I have not changed watches.

But I -</p><p id = "defense">[335] FORD: When you and Officer Hester were walking into the woods, were y'all just clicking photographs one right after the other, one right after the other trying to catch each and everything that y'all did? So she just happened to catch you leaning across the ditch, just happened to catch you falling in the ditch - just by luck, when nobody even knew that you were going to find anything - nothing significant had occurred, but y'all just happened to be taking photographs - is that correct?</p><p id = "defense">[336] ALLEN: Diane Hester uh - at that point was before we realized that we had a tragedy of this - of this nature and at that time, I think she took those photographs 'cause she was poking fun at me because I was fixin' to fall uh - in the water.</p><p id = "defense">[337] FORD: Ok. </p><p id = "defense">[338] ALLEN: Uh -</p><p id = "defense">[339] FORD: So these two pictures were taken as a joke, state's exhibit number 10 and state's exhibit number 11.</p><p id = "defense">[340] ALLEN: That was what I call - at that point, those photographs were taken -</p><p id = "defense">[341] FORD: Because she thought you were fixin' to fall in the water, right? She thought you were fixin' to fall in the water so she said "Well I'll just take a picture, this may be funny" </p><p id = "defense">[342] ALLEN: Yeah, I did fall -</p><p id = "defense">[343] FORD: Is that what she was doing?</p><p id = "defense">[344] ALLEN: - in the water.</p><p id = "defense">[345] FORD: That's right.

The, one team of divers went into, through lot number 244 which is the lot to the west, one lot next to the Baldwin residence. They went through this lot here to the bank and dove in this area. The other, I'd say half of the divers, dived over in this corner, which was a vacant lot, on this side of the lake, that was also--</p><p id = "prosecution">[581] FOGLEMAN: All right, do you know which lot was the vacant lot?

There was another diver, or helper, that manned some ropes and they used some kind of pattern of search to where they went, or the diver would hold the rope and they would go, I guess make a sweep, and go to another section of the rope and make a sweep.</p><p id = "prosecution">[607] FOGLEMAN: All right.

The divers were underwater and I don't know where they're going--you know, I--you know, there's not like a bubble trail or whatever, I don't know exactly--what exactly they searched and how much they searched and they're underwater.</p><p id = "prosecution">[947] WADLEY: But you were out there and watched as they searched and you pretty well know where they went.</p><p id = "prosecution">[948] ALLEN: I saw when they came up in different areas and--</p><p id = "prosecution">[949] WADLEY: Ok. </p><p id = "prosecution">[950] FOGLEMAN: I don't have any objections, Your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[951] WADLEY: Your Honor, we would seek to introduce this as Echols number--(mumbling)--Echols number 7.</p><p id = "prosecution">[952] THE COURT: Alright, it may be received without objection.</p><p id = "prosecution">[953] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[954] THE COURT: Anything else?</p><p id = "prosecution">[955] WADLEY: One other question.

How many other people that you talked with in this investigation live at Lakeshore Trailer Park?</p><p id = "prosecution">[960] ALLEN: Uh--that I talked to personally myself, uh--</p><p id = "prosecution">[961] WADLEY: Or that you have knowledge of within this investigation. How many other people that you all talked to regarding this, live there?</p><p id = "prosecution">[962] ALLEN: I have--I don't know--I don't have a number.</p><p id = "prosecution">[963] WADLEY: How many other suspects lived out there?</p><p id = "prosecution">[964] ALLEN: Uh--I don't have a number--I don't really know.</p><p id = "prosecution">[965] WADLEY: Would you agree with me that there were several?</p><p id = "prosecution">[966] ALLEN: You may have to probably ask Inspector Gitchell that--I don't--I interviewed some witnesses out there, but as far as suspects other than uh--I don't have a number.</p><p id = "prosecution">[967] WADLEY: Ok. We'll ask him. Thank you.</p><p id = "prosecution">[968] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[969] WADLEY: Detective, Prosecutor Fogleman showed you this photograph and asked you, uh--the pier uh--behind the Baldwin trailer, is that right?</p><p id = "prosecution">[970] ALLEN: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[971] WADLEY: Is it your testimony that from the only place out there, this knife could have been thrown in the water is from that pier? Is that your testimony?</p><p id = "prosecution">[972] ALLEN: If it was thrown, uh--I would say it would have been thrown from an area on that side within a given--whatever that person had on his arm reach.</p><p id = "prosecution">[973] WADLEY: So, you're saying--you're saying that you know it was thrown? Is that what you're telling this jury?</p><p id = "prosecution">[974] ALLEN: No, no. I said that if it was thrown, then that would be--</p><p id = "prosecution">[975] WADLEY: Let me ask you something--</p><p id = "prosecution">[976] ALLEN: That would be--on that side of the lake, that would be an area which I would say in--with common sense--it would show--</p><p id = "prosecution">[977] WADLEY: Detective Allen, you--are you saying the only place that that knife could have been placed in the water or the only way that knife could have been placed in the water would be from that pier? Is that what you're saying?</p><p id = "prosecution">[978] ALLEN: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[979] WADLEY: You're not saying that at all, are you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[980] ALLEN: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[981] WADLEY: That knife could have been put out there--</p><p id = "prosecution">[982] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, could he complete his answer?</p><p id = "prosecution">[983] WADLEY: He just finished.</p><p id = "prosecution">[984] FOGLEMAN: He was trying to talk and Mr. Wadley was talking--</p><p id = "prosecution">[985] THE COURT: Give him--</p><p id = "prosecution">[986] WADLEY: I want him to talk, Judge.</p><p id = "prosecution">[987] THE COURT: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[988] ALLEN: Go ahead and ask the question.</p><p id = "prosecution">[989] WADLEY: I thought you had talked, are you not going to finish talking?</p><p id = "prosecution">[990] THE COURT: Go ahead and ask him the question.</p><p id = "prosecution">[991] WADLEY: Detective, that--you're not--you would agree with me that that knife could have been put in that water from anywhere, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[992] ALLEN: I wouldn't say from anywhere. I would--it would make good sense--it would just make common sense that the knife uh--if it was dropped out of a boat, if it was thrown, uh--but as far as when you said while ago, "would that knife been thrown just from the Baldwin residence", I said it would make good sense that side of the bank.</p><p id = "prosecution">[993] WADLEY: I'm asking you--</p><p id = "prosecution">[994] ALLEN: It would be too far from any other sides of the bank.</p><p id = "prosecution">[995] WADLEY: I'm asking you, Detective, that knife could have been placed in there--that's not the only place that knife could have been placed in--isn't that right?

You're not saying that, are you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[1000] ALLEN: I wasn't there--the--I don't know how the knife got to that location.
