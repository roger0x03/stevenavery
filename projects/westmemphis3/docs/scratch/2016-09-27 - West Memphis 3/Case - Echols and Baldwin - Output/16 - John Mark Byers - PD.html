Do you recall giving that response to Inspector Gitchell?</p><p id = "prosecution">[101] BYERS: Seems like my response would have been, no one had been cut with it - you know, that I would have known about and he was referring to my 2 sons or my wife, I guess. </p><p id = "prosecution">[102] PRICE: I asked you a few moments ago if you ever used the knife and you said on one occasion you trimmed some veni - you attempted to trim some venison with it, you remember giving that response?</p><p id = "prosecution">[103] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[104] PRICE: Ok, do you remember being asked by Gitchell - this is on page 4 - "Did you use the knife?" and giving the answer, "I never used it, I would have - hopefully I was going to use it for deer hunting - that's all I do, deer hunt, but I never had an opportunity to use it on a deer."

Want to take a look to see if that's the question he asked, you were asked and that's the specific answer you gave to Gitchell. </p><p id = "prosecution">[112] BYERS: You talking about where I said that Ryan had cut his arm with a knife -</p><p id = "prosecution">[113] PRICE: No sir, I'm talking about the last sentence where the, two lines from the bottom, "Did you use the knife?" Byers, "I never used it. I would have, hopefully I was going to use it for deer hunting, that's all I do, deer hunt, but I never had an opportunity to use it on a deer." Was that the answer you gave?</p><p id = "prosecution">[114] BYERS: Yes sir and uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[115] PRICE: Alright now, if you want to explain, go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[116] BYERS: The reason for that is, I never had an opportunity to use it on a deer 'cause I never hunted with it. It didn't meant that at some time I didn't have some venison in my home and try to use it to cut the venison and he wasn't asking me that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[117] PRICE: Alright, now you didn't tell him on that occasion that you tried, attempted to trim venison with that knife, did you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[118] BYERS: I don't remember. </p><p id = "prosecution">[119] PRICE: Ok. And just to clear that point up, did you ever try, ever use that knife on venison?</p><p id = "prosecution">[120] BYERS: I did. And matter of fact as I was trying to use the knife and cutting the venison to make beef jerky with it, I cut my thumb with it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[121] PRICE: Oh, and you cut your thumb with it? And what was the date on this?</p><p id = "prosecution">[122] BYERS: I don't remember the exact day, it was during the Thanksgiving holidays.</p><p id = "prosecution">[123] PRICE: Alright. And isn't it true that you never told Inspector Gitchell on January 26th that you ever cut your thumb with that particular knife? Did you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[124] BYERS: Yes sir, it seems like during the course of the day, I did tell him that.</p><p id = "prosecution">[125] PRICE: Ok, was that during the taped conversation or was that after?</p><p id = "prosecution">[126] BYERS: I don't remember.</p><p id = "prosecution">[127] PRICE: Ok.

Ok, before looking at the paper, I need to ask you, do you recall being asked the question, "Let me explain a problem we have" -</p><p id = "prosecution">[135] BYERS: You're saying Gitchell's question there? I don't understand what you're asking me.</p><p id = "prosecution">[136] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, again, I object to this procedure. If he wants to ask Mr. Byers any question he wants to about the knife, if Mr. Byers says something inconsistent with the statement, he can ask him all day -</p><p id = "prosecution">[137] THE COURT: Sustained.</p><p id = "prosecution">[138] FOGLEMAN: Object to him using what questions were asked and his answers, it just wasn't -</p><p id = "prosecution">[139] PRICE: Judge, I'm entitled to ask him if he recalls -</p><p id = "prosecution">[140] THE COURT: You're entitled to ask him anything you chose to and if you find that that's inconsistent with, then you can challenge him with the statement but I'm not going to allow you just to read a paraphrase from the statement, ask him did you say this.</p><p id = "prosecution">[141] PRICE: Judge, I'm not paraphrasing, if anything I'm reading the exact quote -</p><p id = "prosecution">[142] THE COURT: That's not the way to cross examine on the statement. Ask him a question, if you think that the statement reflects an inconsistency then you can point it out after you give him an opportunity to refresh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[143] PRICE: I'm trying to do that you Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[144] THE COURT: Alright. Go ahead.</p><p id = "prosecution">[145] PRICE: Did Gitchell tell you, "Let me explain a problem we had and you need to answer this for me, we have found blood on this knife." Did Gitchell ask you that question?</p><p id = "prosecution">[146] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, this is exactly what I'm objecting to. Mr. Price knows how to ask questions and it's irrelevant all that, he can ask Mr. Byers anything he wants about te knife. I object to this line of question -</p><p id = "prosecution">[147] THE COURT: Sustain</p><p id = "prosecution">[148] PRICE: To your knowledge, did they find blood on the knife?</p><p id = "prosecution">[149] BYERS: To my knowledge -</p><p id = "prosecution">[150] PRICE: To your knowledge, did they find blood on the knife?</p><p id = "prosecution">[151] BYERS: What's been brought out in court, they said there was.</p><p id = "prosecution">[152] PRICE: Ok. And on January 26th, Gitchell, did Gitchell tell you there was blood on the knife?</p><p id = "prosecution">[153] BYERS: I don't remember if he said there was or not.</p><p id = "prosecution">[154] PRICE: Alright, I'd like to refresh your recollection, on page 7.</p><p id = "prosecution">[155] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[156] PRICE: Now that you've had a chance to refresh your recollection, did Gitchell tell you, "We've found blood on this knife."?</p><p id = "prosecution">[157] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[158] PRICE: Ok. Did Gitchell tell you that the blood on the knife was Chris' blood?</p><p id = "prosecution">[159] BYERS: I don't remember, it might be in here that he said that, I know the answers be, the answers after that question that Gitchell asked me and my answer.</p><p id = "prosecution">[160] PRICE: Alright. I'm trying to ask you the question first, if you remember the question, I'll then get to your answer.</p><p id = "prosecution">[161] FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, what relevance is it of what questions were asked? What's important is what the man knows and if he gives an inconsistent response, tell all about it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[162] PRICE: Judge, I'm entitled to ask him about the questions that Gitchell asked him. Your Honor, I asked the same questions that Gitchell -</p><p id = "prosecution">[163] THE COURT: (interrupting mumble) - The form of the question asked by the interrogator is not really relevant, his responses and his knowledge of that, of those circumstances are if there's any answers he gave to a question that is inconsistent to the inquiry here today then you're going to be permitted to ask the questions in literature.</p><p id = "prosecution">[164] PRICE: Judge, the court said earlier when I was attempting to question Inspector Gitchell, the court previously ruled that I can ask Mr. Byers the questions that Gitchell asked and the answers he gave. And that's what I'm trying to do your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[165] THE COURT: Well, I don't recall making any such ruling, but the fact is that you may impeach a witness by prior inconsistent statement, but you're just attempting to read the statement or paraphrase parts of the statement. Go ahead and ask your question.</p><p id = "prosecution">[166] PRICE: Judge, I'm not paraphrasing anything, I'm asking direct questions, trying to get his direct answer.</p><p id = "prosecution">[167] THE COURT: Ask him about the circumstances, if he denies it then you can read every word of that statement that is contrary to what his answers are.</p><p id = "prosecution">[168] PRICE: Did you tell Gitchell you had no idea how Chris' blood could be on that knife?</p><p id = "prosecution">[169] BYERS: Yes sir, I would not have any idea, if his blood was on that knife, I would not know how it got there.</p><p id = "prosecution">[170] PRICE: Did you also - did you have any idea, rephrase the question, did you have any idea how human blood was on that knife?</p><p id = "prosecution">[171] BYERS: Well yes I would have an idea, I cut my thumb.</p><p id = "prosecution">[172] PRICE: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[173] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[174] PRICE: Judge, in order to impeach the witness by him making the statement that he had, that he cut his thumb and that's how blood could get on there, I now am entitled to ask him the questions that Gitchell asked concerning this specific topic. Did Gitchell ask you, "The problem is, we have sent this knife off and had it examined and it has the blood type of Chris on it." Did he ask that question?</p><p id = "prosecution">[175] BYERS: That's what's written down here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[176] PRICE: Alright.</p><p id = "prosecution">[177] FOGLEMAN: What page?</p><p id = "prosecution">[178] PRICE: It's on page 7. Um, bottom part. There's a series, there's several questions he asked and several answers you gave, the next, the answer you gave, "Well, Gary, I don't have any idea how any could be on there." and then Gitchell asked, "That's our problem." Correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[179] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[180] PRICE: And then you answered again, "I have no idea how it's on there." And then Gitchell asked again, "Why, why would this knife have blood on it?" And you said, "I have no idea, Gary."</p><p id = "prosecution">[181] BYERS: And when I -</p><p id = "prosecution">[182] PRICE: Correct? Was that the answer you gave?</p><p id = "prosecution">[183] BYERS: May I explain the answer your Honor?</p><p id = "prosecution">[184] THE COURT: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[185] BYERS: When he was referring to that of why would this knife have any blood on it, I was under the assumption that he was talking about Christopher's blood on it, which like I said, I didn't have any idea. He didn't ask me was there any way that any other type of blood or it's substance could have been on there because just a paragraph or two up before that, I told him where I was trying to cut the venison with it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[186] PRICE: On the top of page 8, do you recall being asked the question, "I have no idea, no idea how it could have any human blood on it." You recall giving that answer?</p><p id = "prosecution">[187] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[188] PRICE: And then it's inaudible from Gitchell and then do you recall stating, "I don't even remember nicking myself with it, cutting the deer meat, or anything." Is that the answer you gave?</p><p id = "prosecution">[189] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[190] PRICE: And is that the truth?</p><p id = "prosecution">[191] BYERS: I, at the time when he was questioning me, I didn't re - I mean, I might not have remembered, we were getting ready to go into a trial, uh -</p><p id = "prosecution">[192] PRICE: Alright, did you remember on this date, cutting yourself on, with the venison, or not cutting yourself?</p><p id = "prosecution">[193] BYERS: The date that Gary questioned me?</p><p id = "prosecution">[194] PRICE: The date that Gary questioned you, yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[195] BYERS: I might not have remembered it at that time when he was questioning me, but I could have remembered it -</p><p id = "prosecution">[196] (tape flipped)</p><p id = "prosecution">[197] PRICE: And after you said that you cut yourself with the deer meat, do you recall Gitchell telling you, "We've had it checked and it's not animal's blood, it's what we call higher ape, in other words, the ape of a human family or category." Do you recall him making that statement to you?</p><p id = "prosecution">[198] BYERS: It seems like he did.</p><p id = "prosecution">[199] PRICE: Ok. And at that time, did you tell him you have no idea when Chris could have even ever touched it?</p><p id = "prosecution">[200] BYERS: I don't have any idea of if he ever played with it or could, he could have, but I didn't, I didn't have any knowledge of it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[201] PRICE: One moment your Honor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[202] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[203] PRICE: Let me see the statement. </p><p id = "prosecution">[204] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[205] PRICE: On the night that the boys were missing, did you go search for them?</p><p id = "prosecution">[206] BYERS: Yes.</p><p id = "prosecution">[207] PRICE: Ok, when is the first time that you went searching for them, for Chris?</p><p id = "prosecution">[208] BYERS: When I got home from the courtroom in West Memphis.</p><p id = "prosecution">[209] PRICE: Alright now, your son Ryan had been in court, I believe testifying as a witness in some kind of reckless driving type offense of some kind?</p><p id = "prosecution">[210] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[211] PRICE: Ok. And did, when you, did you go and spend part of the time in court with him, waiting for him to finish testifying?</p><p id = "prosecution">[212] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[213] PRICE: Ok, and did you wear shorts with you on that occasion?</p><p id = "prosecution">[214] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[215] PRICE: Alright.

The bayou's 10 miles long.</p><p id = "prosecution">[340] PRICE: Alright, so you're saying that you were looking in the area of the bayou at 8:30?</p><p id = "prosecution">[341] BYERS: I don't understand your question counselor.</p><p id = "prosecution">[342] PRICE: Alright, you gave an answer saying it, on May the 19th to Officer Sudbury, you talk about leaving at 8:30, it had gotten dark, you and Ryan looking, and then you say, "We were looking in that area of the bayou."</p><p id = "prosecution">[343] THE COURT: Well read the whole thing.</p><p id = "prosecution">[344] PRICE: What - alright. Do you recall being, backing up the whole way this would be on the bottom of page 3. (reading) "Uh, the kids, now I'll get to that later on Thursday - I'll get to that in a minute. Oh, we started looking and looked in that area. It's now probably 8:30, it had got dark and Terry said well, he was going to spread out down you know, towards where they were found. I don't know how far down that way he went, but he was going to look that way and my son Ryan and I and Richie Matchers, excuse me, Richie Masters. Just somehow Richie Masters showed up to help. My son Ryan and I, I think Brett Smith. Richie Masters goes with Brett Smith's sister so that's how they were kinda together. So we're looking in that area kinda where the loop is, you know, there's an open field there, just kind of a circle around it out there. We were looking in that area of the bayou and uh, well, I had a pair of shorts and a pair of flip flops, so I run back to the house and I changed clothes then I put me on some coveralls and boots and I had that on me probably for the next 3 or 4, 2 or 3 days. I went back out there, I made a path, I went all the way back to the back and walked up to the gully where it makes a real wash down and you could see where the water washes into the bayou. I didn't have a flashlight or anything with me, I thought well, I'm going to go borrow a flashlight from Robert Fountain. I knew he just lived down the street from me. I knew I'd borrow a flashlight from somebody. So, I came back out, I see a police car pull up and it was Officer Moore, I believe, and he did say, 'Did you find something?' I said 'No'. I said 'But I don't have a light, will you help me look?' He said 'Yeah. I'll help you.' So he got his light out and we walked back to that trail and then we cut back up to this side which runs into the ditch, kinda that's a still ditch, it's got that rope hanging down from a tree." Do you remember giving that answer?</p><p id = "prosecution">[345] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[346] PRICE: So, just to back up, at 8:30, It's probably 8:30 and it had gotten dark, correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[347] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[348] PRICE: And then you look, that's the time you left the house with Ryan and his other friend and that's when you were wearing, still wearing your shorts and flip flops. Correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[349] BYERS: Yes sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[350] PRICE: And at that time, when you left, you did not have a flashlight?</p><p id = "prosecution">[351] BYERS: No sir.</p><p id = "prosecution">[352] PRICE: And then you went back to the, and then, then you went and looked in the area of the bayou? Correct?</p><p id = "prosecution">[353] BYERS: Seems like after I came back, I mean when I was down there with Ryan and the other people that showed up, I looked a little ways, just right there as you go in the trail goes straight back to the bayou back on this end and where that rope is, where Officer Moore was talking about -</p><p id = "prosecution">[354] PRICE: What area, if you could, point to that area. Do you recall where the area where the rope is?</p><p id = "prosecution">[355] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[356] BYERS: Alright, this is the little ditch that runs right here. And that runs in, I guess this is the bayou here -</p><p id = "prosecution">[357] PRICE: The bayou runs all the way through here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[358] BYERS: Ok. That little rope that we found was over here on this little ditch here.</p><p id = "prosecution">[359] PRICE: Alright.

Just a moment Judge.</p><p id = "prosecution">[364] (pause)</p><p id = "prosecution">[365] PRICE: On May the 19th, did Officer Ridge tell you that he might have information that you had something to do with the disappearance of the boys?</p><p id = "prosecution">[366] BYERS: Excuse me?</p><p id = "prosecution">[367] PRICE: On May the 19th, did Officer Ridge tell you that he had information that you had something to do with the disappearance of the boys?</p><p id = "prosecution">[368] BYERS: I don't remember Officer Ridge, I remember him talking with me when I went down to the police station and they were questioning me, you know, as they were bringing people down there to question about it.</p><p id = "prosecution">[369] PRICE: Ok. Let me ask you this specific question, this is on page 30. (reading) Ridge: "Ok, well what I want to say right now or what I'm going to say is that I may have information, this information suggests strongly that you have something to do with the disappearance of the boys and ultimately the murders. Ok, what is your response to that?" Do you recall being asked that question by Officer Ridge on May the 19th?</p><p id = "prosecution">[370] BYERS: It seems like when he asked me that, that I got very upset and distraught and then he told me that he had to just ask me that question to get my reaction.</p><p id = "prosecution">[371] PRICE: Ok. At that time, you told him um, did you tell him you had no idea how he would get that information?</p><p id = "prosecution">[372] BYERS: I probably would have said I don't have any idea where you would have got that information or where that would have come from.</p><p id = "prosecution">[373] PRICE: Alright. </p><p id = "prosecution">[374] BYERS: Officer Ridge indicated to me that he just said that to me, like he said, to get my reaction.</p><p id = "prosecution">[375] PRICE: Ok.</p><p id = "prosecution">[376] BYERS: Like he really didn't have any of that information or proof, he was just saying that -</p><p id = "prosecution">[377] PRICE: - Just trying to get your reaction.</p><p id = "prosecution">[378] BYERS: To get my response.</p><p id = "prosecution">[379] PRICE: Alright.
