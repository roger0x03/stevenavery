West Memphis Three Trials: 
The Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin Trial (February 28 - March 18, 1994)

Christy Van Vickle
Witness for the Prosecution
March 9, 1994
 

(BENCH CONFERENCE )

FORD: We request that the testimony of the little girls they're going to call that were present -- that the State is in agreement to a cautionary instruction that their testimony is to be received only as to Echols.

FOGLEMAN: We don't have any objection to that. The girls overheard Damien saying something. Jason was present, and they're going to say that, but we don't have any objection to the instruction. There were other people present as well, but we don't have any objection to it. To the instruction.

THE COURT: Alright. 

FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, these, this are the other 8 pages, the first of that document.

THE COURT: I can't read it. Have you already given this to 'em?

FOGLEMAN: No sir. That, I was gonna let them make copies.


(RETURN TO OPEN COURT)

FOGLEMAN: Call Christy Van -- oh, excuse me.

DAVIS: Your Honor, the State would call Dr. Duke Jennings of the Doctors Pathology Service.

THE COURT: Alright.

WADLEY: What's the name again?

DAVIS: Dr. Duke Jennings.

WADLEY: May we approach, your Honor?

THE COURT: Alright.


(BENCH CONFERENCE) 

FORD: Your Honor, this witness was not identified.

WADLEY: You already made a ruling that he would be allowed to testify in rebuttal only. That's what the Court already said.

THE COURT: Is this the witness that you are calling to testify about time of death?

DAVIS: Yes, sir.

THE COURT: Well. Of course, I noted the basis for the new trial in the other case was that the Medical Examiner changed his testimony, and I guess you couldn't have anticipated that change or didn't know about it before the trial, but I think what I'll do is let him testify in rebuttal.

FORD: I thought you had already made that ruling.

THE COURT: I don't know whether I did or not. I might have.

DAVIS: What, what is their objection, for the record?

FORD: It's failure to provide his name pursuant to discovery and pursuant to the Court's order to provide a list of witnesses for your case-in-chief ten days prior to trial.

THE COURT: I don't know how you could anticipate a witness that previously testified as to the same facts and circumstances would change his testimony, though. It seems a little unfair, but...

FORD: Your Honor, that's their argument -

WADLEY: -- Judge, you had already made that ruling.

THE COURT: Well, I'm going to let him testify in rebuttal.

FOGLEMAN: Your Honor, before we -- Your Honor, on that judicial notice of adjudicated facts, I'd like for you to look at that rule.

PRICE: What's this going to?

FOGLEMAN: The full moon.

PRICE: Alright.

THE COURT: (PAUSE WHILE EXAMINING) Well, yeah, I think you're probably correct. And it would fall under A.R.E. Rule 201 B(2), where the fact to be noticed was capable of accurate and ready determination by sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.

FOGLEMAN: And we got the thing from the Farmer's Almanac.

THE COURT: The weather service and the ASCS office keeps moon records as well, I believe. There are several government agencies that keep it. It's not really subject of much dispute so what you are wanting to do is introduce this table?

UNKNOWN: Well, your Honor, we just want -- we just want --

(MUTTERING ABOUT COPIES)

THE COURT: It just seems to me to be something that's not...here's the one that you want, right here.

(MUMBLING ABOUT ALMANAC, WEATHER CHANNEL, etc.)

FOGLEMAN: What is y'alls position on this?

PRICE: We don't object.

FOGLEMAN: Okay. They don't object, your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Without objection. Is this your book or mine?

FOGLEMAN: That's mine.

WADLEY: One last thing --

THE COURT: Yeah, I got the later version.

WADLEY: ...a cautionary instruction, before the witness testifies...

THE COURT: I don't remember, but I don't have any objection.

WADLEY: ...before the witness...

THE COURT: Usually.


(BACK TO OPEN COURT)

FOGLEMAN: Call Christy Van Vickle.

THE COURT: I believe this witness has requested not to be photographed.

FOGLEMAN: That's correct, your Honor.

THE COURT: Alright.

THE COURT: Come right - 

(pause)

THE COURT: You need to raise your right hand to be sworn. Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth in the matter now pending before the court so help you God?
